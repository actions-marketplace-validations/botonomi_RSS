<item>	<title>Use relative units for fonts (rem, em)</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/904</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I see that this website uses pixel values on "application.scss" file. I suggest to convert pixel values used for fonts and spacing to relative fonts like "rem’" or "em". This will lead to accessibility of the site and rank higher on Google.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Internationalization / i18n / multilingual site</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/68</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Would love to see about baking in I18N support to choosealicense.com proper. See #67 and #62</p>
<p>We already have the bulk of the strings in a single file (<code>_config.yml</code>), so it should just be a matter of abstracting out some of our variables, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Would love to take this on starting in August if there’s interest. Would be a great exercise to set a standard for Jekyll L10N, and can iterate on some of the lessons learned form https://github.com/CMSgov/healthcare.gov.</p>

<p>It might also be good to list a few examples demonstrating the case sensitive behavior.</p>

<div type="discussions-op-text">
<p><sup>Originally posted by <strong>Andre601</strong> October 27, 2021</sup>
Just recently discovered that you can append <code>gh_color_mode=light</code> or <code>gh_color_mode=dark</code> to a githubusercontent.com hosted image to only show it while the user is using the respective mode.</p>
I feel like this should be mentioned in the docs somewhere, probably under the markdown syntax docs in the images section, so that people are aware of it.

<p>There’s a big warning in the linked page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use credentials that are minimally scoped:
<ul>
<li>Make sure the credentials being used within workflows have the least privileges required, and be mindful that any user with write access to your repository has read access to all secrets configured in your repository.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s really easy to read/skim past this the way the document is structured now.</p>
<p>I propose we add a new heading: <code>Strongly consider who you give write rights to</code> and
put the warning "Be mindful that any user with write access to your repository has read access to all secrets configured in your repository." in that section.</p>
<p>I suggest styling the warning message itself as a warning box with a red background, or something similar to really capture the attention of the reader.</p>

<item>	<title>Update "Configuring nameservers using the administrative shell" to include a note about 127.0.0.1</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/11080</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="issue-overview">Issue overview</h3>
<p>Sometimes customers want to change their nameservers. They simply read <a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.19/admin/installation/configuring-dns-nameservers#configuring-nameservers-using-the-administrative-shell">Configuring DNS nameservers</a> and start making changes to the <em>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head</em> file. We have seen some cases where customers just remove this:</p>
<pre><code>nameserver 127.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>And got a ton of <code>500</code> errors after restarting <code>resolvconf</code>.</p>
<p>This is warned in the <em>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head</em> file:</p>
<pre><code># DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE DIRECTLY. YOUR MODIFICATIONS WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.
#
# For static IP configurations, nameservers can be specified via `ghe-setup-network&#39;.
# For DHCP configurations, nameservers are auto-populated with values provided in the DHCP lease.
# To add custom options to this file, edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head and run `sudo service resolvconf restart&#39;.
#
# The 127.0.0.1 entry is *required* to be the first entry in the list here. Removing it
# or having another entry as the first entry will break GitHub Enterprise. It&#39;s also not
# supported to add options that affect the ordering here such as \&quot;options rotate\&quot;.</code></pre>
<p>But the same content should be documented. Ideally we should have something like this:</p>

<p>When OpenSSH is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">installed using the Settings</a> (Window 10 build 1809 and later; or Windows Server 2019), the <code>ssh-agent</code> runs as a background system service rather than returning a stringified batch script that needs to be <code>eval</code>’d.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683092/how-to-run-ssh-add-on-windows#:~:text=Update%202019%20-%20A%20better%20solution%20if%20you%27re%20using%20Windows%2010%3A%20OpenSSH%20is%20available%20as%20part%20of%20Windows%2010%20which%20makes%20using%20SSH%20from%20cmd/powershell%20much%20easier%20in%20my%20opinion.%20It%20also%20doesn%27t%20rely%20on%20having%20git%20installed%2C%20unlike%20my%20previous%20solution.">2019 update to top answer on "How to run ssh-add on windows?"</a></p>
<p>This means that the status quo instructions promoting either <code>eval $(ssh-agent -s)</code> or <code>eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"</code> will not work for some users, but will also not provide useful output. For me, either above command does nothing in PowerShell or cmd.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>A succinct emendation is to recommend <code>Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Get-Process</code> in a PowerShell host to find the <code>ssh-agent</code> process ID.</p>
<p>A more detailed suggestion is to walk the reader through scrupulously determining what is providing <code>ssh-agent</code>, if anything.</p></pre> ]]></description>

</ul>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Seven months ago I worked on an issue #974 and submitted PR #1256 and #2988. There was performance concern over making shell files executable explicitly inside the Docker. This
https://github.com/github/docs/pull/1256#discussion_r542055469 has all the discussion.</p>
<p>Ultimately it was decided to suggest the users to run <code>chmod +x entrypoint.sh</code> on their machine before pushing it to the remote. I was not convinced that this will work and there won’t be any permission issue while running the script inside GitHub Actions and I am still not convinced.</p>
<h2 id="root-of-the-problem.">Root of the problem.</h2>
<p>For the most part, the above method works fine. The problem occurs only when someone clones the repo and then make changes. The permission is reset and it no longer can be run inside GitHub Actions. And that is why you will see a lot of developers/organizations have explicitly made the shell executable inside GitHub Actions before running it.</p>
<p>## What do I suggest
Git provides a way to explicitly change the permission mode of a file so that it doesn’t get reset every time there is a clone/fork. The command works as below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a> <span class="fu">git</span> update-index --chmod=+x entrypoint.sh</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will change the permission mode of the file in the git index and it can be checked by running following command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> ls-files --stage entrypoint.sh</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span class="co"># output</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span class="ex">100755</span> e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 0       entrypoint.sh</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here <code>755</code> denotes the executable permission.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>These lines here https://github.com/github/docs/blame/main/content/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action.md#L124-L128 have no use and can be removed if we opt for the above solution.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<p>The section "Configuring a service account and storing its credentials" has this call documented:</p>

  --member=serviceAccount:$SA_EMAIL \
  --role=roles/container.admin \

  --role=roles/container.clusterViewer</code></pre>
<p>But it seems that <code>add-iam-policy-binding</code> can only take one <code>--role</code> argument at a time.</p>
<p>For instance, this will cause a failure during <code>docker push</code>:</p>
<pre><code>denied: Token exchange failed for project &#39;***&#39;. Caller does not have permission &#39;storage.buckets.get&#39;. To configure permissions, follow instructions at: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control</code></pre>
<p>The example given is otherwise able to correctly auth with gcloud, configure docker, and get credentials for the GKE cluster, but then fails to push to <code>gcr.io</code>.</p>
<p>Looking through the output of <code>add-iam-policy-binding</code>, the new service account is only listed in the <code>role: roles/container.clusterViewer</code> section.</p>
<p>It seems that whatever the last <code>--role</code> given to <code>add-iam-policy-binding</code> is the role that will actually be applied to the binding without an error.</p>

<item>	<title>[Improvement]: Add instructions for increasing resources for GitHub Enterprise Server instances on Azure and Google Cloud Platform</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/9240</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p><strong>What feature or product is affected?</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Enterprise Server.</p>
<p><strong>What is the new or expected behavior?</strong></p>
<p>It’d be good to include some advice for increasing hardware resources available to GitHub Enterprise Server instances in Azure or Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p><strong>How is the old or inaccurate behavior currently documented?</strong></p>
<p>Per https://github.com/github/docs-internal/pull/17498#discussion_r566528908, "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/enterprise-management/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources">Increasing CPU or memory resources</a>" only addresses GitHub Enterprise Server instances hosted on AWS, KVM, and VMware. It’d be nice to include instructions for increasing resources for instances hosted on Azure and Google Cloud Platform, or at least write a blurb at the top of the page with any known limitations or high-level instructions. (We link to this article from the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance">various articles on installing GitHub Enterprise Server</a>, so right now, administrators on Azure and Google Cloud Platform might end up at this article, but they won’t see any instructions for their hypervisor.)</p>
<p><strong>Who does this affect?</strong></p>
<p>Administrators of GitHub Enterprise Server using Azure or Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p><strong>What is the impact to users?</strong></p>
<p>Folks might contact support for instructions. Since GitHub doesn’t own Azure or Google Cloud Platform, sometimes we then have to point the customer to other documentation, so it’s potentially a frustrating adventure to find the information that you need for upgrading the virtual machine you’re running 😅</p>

<h3 id="content-design-plan">Content design plan</h3>
<p>We mention that you can use Dependabot with private repositories and registries in quite a few places, but you’re right that we don’t mention that private repositories are not supported for all ecosystems. I suggest that make the following changes to the docs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/data/reusables">reusable</a> that explains that private repositories are not supported for all ecosystems.</li>
<li>Replace the following text in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates">Enabling and disabling version updates</a> with the new reusable.
&gt; Additionally, Dependabot doesn’t support private GitHub dependencies for all package managers. For more information, see "<a href="/github/administering-a-repository/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems">About Dependabot version updates</a>" and "<a href="/github/getting-started-with-github/github-language-support">GitHub language support</a>."</li>
<li>Add the reusable to the following articles:

<p>It would be nice to have a section about transferring action repositories and another about some finer details regarding the marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repo can be transferred and actions will continue to work because there is a redirect in place (users of the action won’t have to update their workflows)</li>
<li>An action in the marketplace is linked to a repository by ID, allowing for new releases to be published under the same marketplace listing from the "new" repo</li>
<li>If an action repository is deleted, so is the marketplace listing. The unique <code>name</code> identifier becomes available again.</li>
<li>The <code>verified</code> status seen on GitHub org profiles is different from the marketplace <code>verified</code> badge. By transferring an action repo, the owner changes and the marketplace badge will be lost unless the new owner is a verified publisher too.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is common for projects to include a secret for deploying things and an action that uses that secret.</p>
<p>When one forks that repository, the secret won’t be present and the workflow will break.</p>
<p>This experience is incredibly painful.</p>
<p>With just a bit of extra code in a workflow, the ❌ ’s go away. But, w/o documentation on how to do it, 99% of workflow authors won’t.</p>
<p>Here’s an example which fixed one (of a number of failing workflows):

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-article-on-docs.github.com-is-affected">What article on docs.github.com is affected?</h3>
<p>Two map topics (task-based groupings of articles):
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github">Getting started with searching on GitHub</a>”
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github">Searching on GitHub</a>”</p>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>Each of these map topics needs an intro to help orient users to the content on the page. Intros should be one sentence long. For more information on writing intros, see:
- <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-model.md#map-topic">Information about map topics</a>” in the GitHub Docs content model, including guidance on map topic intros

- <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/tree/main/content#intro">Information about the <code>intro</code> frontmatter property</a> in the GitHub Docs content directory README
- Make sure your intro is general enough to cover the content in each version of the page (use the version picker in the upper-right corner of the page to see what’s included on the page for different versions of GitHub)</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-article-on-docs.github.com-is-affected">What article on docs.github.com is affected?</h3>
<p>This could effect a variety of GitHub articles, since we want to add links in articles, where it makes sense, to GitHub Classroom articles.</p>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>Here are 4 examples of articles that could benefit from a link to GitHub Classroom articles:
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-template-repository">Creating a template repository</a>” - To this article about template repositories, we can add a link to this GitHub Classroom article “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-assignment-from-a-template-repository">Create an assignment from a template repository</a>” so that those learning how to create a template repository are aware they can be used in GitHub Classroom.
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment#creating-a-pull-request-for-feedback">Create an individual assignment</a>” - To this page in GitHub Classroom, the section “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment#creating-a-pull-request-for-feedback">Creating a pull request for feedback</a>” which is specifically about enabling feedback pull requests to be automatically created for each student submission, we can add a link to this article, “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests">Leave feedback with pull requests</a>” , which goes into more detail about how to leave feedback in those pull requests.
- To either “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/about-integrations">About integrations</a>” or “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/github-extensions-and-integrations">GitHub extensions and integrations</a>”, we can link out to “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide">Integrate GitHub Classroom with an IDE</a>”, in the context of giving an example of an integration with GitHub specific to education, allowing students to develop in an online IDE.
- This is a bit more vague, but we could add a link in some page about GitHub Actions, such as “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration">About continuous integration</a>” to “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/use-autograding">Use autograding</a>” as an example of one way continuous integration and GitHub Actions is used, in an education/classroom context.</p>
<p>There may be other articles out there that could also use links to GitHub Classroom articles (including GitHub Classroom articles themselves) - feel free to explore and find other places!</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>When you add the link, you would usually want to add it a new paragraph or a "Further reading" section if it doesn’t fit in any of the existing sections. When we link to other articles, we often start with "For more information, see [link]". In this case, you could also say something like "To see an example of how [feature] is used in GitHub Classroom, see [link]" - whatever wording makes clear why they might find it useful or of interest to go to that link.</p>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>the part that you can use a token for maven-repositories is wrong. You can see here, that you still need to defined username and password even when you use a token, as you can see in this PR https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/3403/files#diff-48b048f6d8a8b732434e30d186e65de8e3303c03308c116f8e078697b372abecR312
If you try to use the "token" keyword you will get an error from dependabot, so the documentation is not up-to-date for maven-repositories.</p>

<p>_Update May 6, 2021 ✏️ by <span class="citation" data-cites="felicitymay_">@felicitymay_</span></p>
<p>I looked into this problem with the engineering team. I wanted to make sure that this was a docs issue and not a bug in Dependabot. During our investigation, it became clear that the existing information about <code>username</code>, <code>password</code> and <code>token</code> was too brief and that this issue needed a larger-scale change to the article.</p>
<h4 id="tech-summary">Tech summary</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>token</code> is used to provide an access token for an external system and should not be used to provide a GitHub personal access token. It’s supported only by: <code>npm-registry</code>, <code>nuget-feed</code>, <code>python-index</code>, <code>rubygems-server</code>. As highlighted by this issue, it is not supported for <code>maven-repository</code>.</li>
<li><code>username</code> should be an account username or email address.</li>
<li><code>password</code> should be a password for the account specified by the <code>username</code>. If this is a GitHub account, you can use a GitHub personal access token in place of the password.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="docs-changes-needed">Docs changes needed</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#configuration-options-for-private-registries">Configuration options for private registries</a> section:
<ul>
<li>Expand the information in the table for <code>token</code>, <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> so that their use is clear. In particular, explain that a <code>token</code> is for an external system and that when you want to use a GitHub access token you should supply it as a <code>password</code>.</li>
<li>Update all descriptions: "The <system> type supports username and password." to explain that the password can be a GitHub personal access token.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#registries">registries</a> section:
<ul>
<li>Update the <code>maven-github</code> example to use a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> with an access token.</li>
<li>Remove <code>token</code> from this example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="https://docs-5868--patch-1.herokuapp.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#git">git</a> example, change the username to: <code>username: octocat</code>.</li>
<li>In the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#maven-repository">maven-repository</a> section:
<ul>
<li>Remove "token" from the description.</li>
<li>Update the description to match those for other systems that only support a username and password.</li>
<li>Update the second example to use a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> with an access token.</li>

<p>There is no documentation for an admin explaining how to let non admins see the security alerts.</p>

From the former:
&gt; If a team has enabled code review assignments, the individual approvals won’t satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For more information, see "Managing code review assignment for your team."</p>
<p>From the latter:
&gt; When code owners are automatically requested for review, the team is still removed and replaced with individuals. The individual approvals don’t satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For more information, see "About code owners."</p>
<p>Based on our internal testing, <strong>this is no longer correct.</strong> The team is not removed from the PR, and the round robin reviewer can approve the PR successfully. Additionally, if code review assignment is enabled and set not to notify the team, only the single reviewer will be requested as intended.</p>

<h3 id="what-article-on-docs.github.com-is-affected">What article on docs.github.com is affected?</h3>
<p>https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/managing-complex-workflows#creating-dependent-jobs and/or https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds</p>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>In https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/managing-complex-workflows#creating-dependent-jobs, the possibility of constraining jobs to run sequentially without the failure of earlier jobs in the sequence preventing the later jobs from running: <em>If one of the jobs fails, all dependent jobs are skipped; however, if you need the jobs to continue, you can define this using the if conditional statement.</em></p>
<p>I had expected, thus, to see an example of how to do this, either directly here or in one of the two linked-to articles (either https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif or https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds).</p>
<p>It is not clear what sort of "if" statement is called for, nor whether it should supplement or replace the "needs" directive. The https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds article reiterates the possibility of constraining jobs to run in sequence without failing jobs preventing later jobs from running: <em>If a job fails, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional statement that causes the job to continue.</em> This at least suggests that the "if" statement supplements the "needs" directive, but again, there is no example given of how to do this.</p>
<p>Since the <em>Creating dependent jobs</em> article occurs in the <em>Learn GitHub Actions</em> section of the documentation, it would probably be better to just omit the comment about allowing dependent jobs to run when their precursors fail, or at least to provide or link to an example the clarifies how to set this up.</p>

<p>Every change to an <code>#anchor</code> name for endpoint titles requires a change in the code, due to the error handlers which include a URL to the documentation. The endpoint titles are more prone to changes, while operation IDs should be changed much less frequently, as they are consider a breaking change to some of the OpenAPI consumers, while the <code>\"summary\"</code> key is not.</p>
<p>The problem with the title changes might also be amplified once translations are introduced.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Any interest in supporting F#?</p>
<p>We have our own compiler APIs that enable all kinds of stuff based on structure and semantics; and it’s part of the compiler proper, not some janky thing that breaks because the compiler changed stuff. You can see this in the Fable REPL, which supports a wide range of tooling features in the editor: https://fable.io/repl/</p>
<p>Based on looking at how you do things, you wouldn’t be able to use this directly, which would imply a lot of work. F# syntax and semantic aren’t trivial 😅. But if there was a way to extend this to allow the existing tooling support (which can run in a browser!), then we might be able to prioritize stuff on the F# side of things to make it easier.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<p>But I had trouble figuring out how to build for <code>GOARCH=386</code> without errors. Right now, we use https://github.com/egor-tensin/setup-mingw to switch to 32-bit builds, which pulls down a bunch of tooling and takes a few minutes:</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel there must still be a nice (or at least much faster) way to do this using the built-in tools from Actions.</p></pre> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h2 id="feature-request">Feature request</h2>
<p>Hello, how could this be done? In the javascript documentation the configuration needed to use webpack is indicated, but I am interested in using stimulus using importmap and sprockets, as it will be in rails 7 by default, using the asset pipeline.</p>
<p>Could this be added to the documentation?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How have y’all at Github approached testing view components that have an interactive component to them? We’ve mainly been unit testing each view component we add and then writing feature specs for browser interactions, but I’m wondering if there is a better way to approach it - RailsConf Q&amp;A</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h3>
<p>In Primer ViewComponents, we use system tests powered by cuprite and ViewComponent Previews for testing behaviors. As this approach matures, we should aim to move of much of it as possible into ViewComponent.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Support multiple views</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/387</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h2 id="feature-request">Feature request</h2>
<!-- Provide a summary of the behavior. -->
<p>Allow refactoring small view parts into a separate view, and be able to <code>render</code> them into the template. These views should not be available outside the component.</p>
<pre><code>app/components/my_component/my_component.html.erb
app/components/my_component/a_part.html.erb</code></pre>
<pre class="erb"><code>&lt;%# my_component.html.erb %&gt;
&lt;%= render &#39;a_part&#39; %&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<!-- What would you like to do with this feature? Can you provide
context or references to similar behavior in other libraries? -->
<p>Sometimes it is useful to separate a sub-component from the component. For example, if I want to render a popover with extra info about a particular model, I would want to extract that popover into a separate view.</p>
<p>Alternative Solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extract a new component. Because the popover is not a generic one to be used in other parts of the application, it doesn’t make much sense to create a (now public) component for it.</li>
<li>Use <code>content_for</code>. This is not suitable if the partial needs to take arguments. In my example, it wouldn’t work if I’m displaying a list of models and I want to show the popover for each model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prior art:
ActionView does support partials, of course.
Cells does allow multiple views per cell, and allows using <code>render view: 'a_part'</code>.</p>
<h3 id="possible-solutions-i-see">Possible solutions I see</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provide a method that prefixes the component dir and then goes on to call <code>render template:</code> with the full path. I would suspect this is relatively slow given that <code>render</code> is slow in ActionView.</li>
<li>Precompile all the templates into methods with a reserved prefix, and allow calling them from the view. For example, using <code>extra_views_{view_name}</code>.</li>
</ol></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Components should play nicely with Rails caching mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/234</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="feature-request">Feature request</h3>
<p>Components should provide a digest to Rails views, or be able to use Rails explicit caching directive comments or be able to provide a cache_key.</p>
<p>Essentially we should be able to invalidate a cache based on whether the Component class or template has changed.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I’m just building on some previous reports primarily around where templates live and the filenames of the template/s. My concerns come down to integrating with Rails caching basics.</p>
<p>The issue that we run into is basically summed up by</p>
<pre><code>## In any view/partial
cache[object, another_object] do
  render(MyComponent.new(attribute: value))
end</code></pre>
<p>In this case if the template for <code>MyComponent</code> is changed the cache will not be invalidated. I tried to add <code>MyComponent</code> to the array used by <code>cache</code> and provide a <code>self.cache_key</code> method that used <code>ActionView::Digestor</code> but without having some further mechanism to invalidate the digestor’s cache for the template/s when the template changes this didn’t work.</p>
<p>Rails allows for explicit directives to be used (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#explicit-dependencies) but by default this will only look inside <code>app/views</code>. You can add a view path <code>append_view_path(\"app/components\")</code> but the digestor is expecting a partial and so a template filename would have to be prefixed with underscore.</p>
<p>The way we are currently working around this is to have an <code>ApplicationComponent</code> that our components inherit from and where we override <code>ActionView::Component::Base.matching_views_in_source_location</code> so that templates are now found in <code>app/views/component_templates</code> and where the files are prefixed with underscore.</p>
<pre><code>  def self.matching_views_in_source_location
    return [] unless source_location

    *path, file_name = source_location.chomp(File.extname(source_location)).split(\&quot;/\&quot;)
    path.pop # remove components
    path.concat([\&quot;views\&quot;, \&quot;component_templates\&quot;])
    path_to_template = path.push(\&quot;_#{ file_name }\&quot;).join(\&quot;/\&quot;)

    Dir[\&quot;#{ path_to_template }.*{#{ActionView::Template.template_handler_extensions.join(&#39;,&#39;)}}\&quot;]
  end</code></pre>
<p>Then in the above example where cache invalidation does not work via template digest changes we can do</p>
<pre><code>## In any view/partial
# Template Dependency: component_templates/my_component %&gt;
cache[object, another_object] do
  render(MyComponent, attribute: value)
end</code></pre>
<p>I think if AV::C is going to be core or integrate with Rails it would need a way to expose template digests nicely, or provide <code>cache_key</code> probably at the class level. If not then as a last resort we would need a way to use explicit directives in templates that use ActionView::Components internally.</p>
<p>I’d also be all 👂 to people who have solved this already or if I’ve missed something about the features <code>ActionView::Component</code> provides!</p></pre> ]]></description>

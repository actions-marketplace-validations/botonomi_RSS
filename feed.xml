	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I'm trying to run a 4 x Pi4 cluster.

Was previously running on 1.18, but I was using latest/stable and things started going wonky this week - issues with pods talking to those on different nodes. When I started looking into things, I noticed it had upgraded to 1.19 at some point. The two <em>may</em> be related, but may not.

In the process of trying to work out what was going on, things got a whole lot worse:
<code>microk8s status</code> said that microk8s wasn't running.
<code>microk8s inspect</code> said everything was fine.
<code>microk8s kubectl</code> said it couldn't connect.

I didn't have a whole lot on my cluster at this point, and everything important is on PVs, so decided to rebuild my cluster, redeploy etc, so I snap removed microk8s from each node, re-installed, checked HA was enabled (because it seems to be a good idea!), re-added the nodes and things were still screwy, but in a different way.

I use lens to manage my cluster and I noticed that lens kept getting disconnected about every 5-10 minutes. I tried deploying something and the deployment was created but no pods were every spun up... I tried looking at logs etc but couldn't find anything obvious so decided to start properly from scratch and reinstalled ubuntu 20.04 on the 4 sd cards.

I've now reinstalled microk8s on each node, checked HA is enabled, added a few other features and added all the nodes... and it still doesn't seem happy.

I'm regularly getting this (though not as often as before I reinstalled from scratch!):

plus one of my nodes, which initially showed as ready, has tu
ed &quot;unhappy&quot; (the wa
ings are because the node has change to &quot;unready&quot;):

I decided to get take a screenshot of just using kubectl and whilst writing this, the same has happened to node 3:

	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I set up a multi-node install of microk8s 1.19, and enabled storage.

However, when I try to deploy a statefulset with a volume template, I run into issues.

The server pod can be brought up on a different node from the one the PV is actually created on, causing the pod to fail to start, as the directory for the volume does not exist. Is this expected? How can I ensure the volume is provisioned on the correct node?

Here's the relevant bit from my helm template with the volume claim:

This doesn't concern these tools.nnSome tools can't, like go-lang and probably any other language support we add in the future. We should have an upgrade workflow for these tools.nnActually upgrading the tools should be easy due to our policy of always getting the latest upstream - remove&install. What we should improve is the way users know what needs to be updated.nnA subset of our tools should support reporting the version of a tool back. So when we install a tool, the version goes into the config file.nnThen users can ask umake - list all tools that have updates. We go through all installed tools from the config file, check if their modules support versioning. If they do, fetch latest upstream version, compare with the current version (if current version is missing, because the tool was installed before we added support for versions, flag as 'update available') and list everything that can be updated.n"

	<description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Hi</strong>
Related to the discussion in #2251 

The outcome might just be to leave everything as it is, but if you have any thought please leave them below <span class="citation">@ubuntujaggers</span> <span class="citation">@Feichtmeier</span> <span class="citation">@clobrano</span> <span class="citation">@Jupiter007-43</span> <span class="citation">@avil25

My</span> questions on the current icons:
- The Flatpak pictogram is monochrome. Should they all be this way? Or should we add color to the Flatpak icon?
- Is that a Windows logo? Why not change it like Eaglersdeveloper <a href="https://github.com/snwh/suru-icon-theme/issues/65#issuecomment-399678431">suggested</a>?
- Because the Window files are binary, should they have a solid background too or...?
- Should all of these icons really be packages?
- Or just leave everything as it is 👌 

I have to admit that I'm in a bit over my head here with all the file types, so please be patient 😅

The fold would be a clear distinction between the application and file icons.

_Enhanced, Fold and current_ 👆 

For a long time now, I've found the paper curl at the bottom of the mimetype icons to be too subtle. At the moment, the current curl is only present at 256 px (and above ofc). 
The fold would be a clear distinction between the application and file icons.

Adding the top fold, is a very controversial suggestion and it's also a massive amount of work to adapt the current 54 icons. A less intrusive suggestion is to increase the current curl.

In no particular order, here's document icons from OSX, Windows, Humanity, Adwaita, Papirus and Yaru 📄

The combination of `-D gnome-shell-gresource=true` and a theme name other than `Yaru` seems to be the problem.rnrn## Expected Behaviorrnrn- Successful login using `YaruTest` as shell themernrn## Actual Behaviorrnrn- Black screen for a couple of seconds, then returns to login screenrnrn## Steps to Reproduce the Problemrnrn- Change theme name to `YaruTest` (in meson.build)rn- Build yaru using `-D gnome-shell-gresource=true`rn- Log outrn- Select the `YaruTest` session and loginrnrn## Software that presents the issuernrn- Ubuntu 20.04 / Gnome 3.36.1rnrn## Yaru versionrnrn- Current master (1c3f661)rnrn## SolutionrnrnAfter some digging into this issue, I discovered that the theme name `Yaru` is hardcoded in `gnome-shell/src/data/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml`:rnrn```rn    ...rn    <file alias="Yaru/gnome-shell.css">gnome-shell.css</file>rn    <file alias="Yaru/gnome-shell-high-contrast.css">gnome-shell-high-contrast.css</file>rn    <file alias="Yaru-dark/gnome-shell.css">gnome-shell-dark.css</file>rn    <file alias="Yaru-dark/gnome-shell-high-contrast.css">gnome-shell-high-contrast-dark.css</file>rn    ...rn```rnrnReplacing `Yaru` with `YaruTest` in that file solves the issue for me. I don't know how this should properly be fixed. I think it'd be possible to make meson put the project name into the file during build. Another option might be to remove the theme name from the aliases completely, but I'm not sure if that plays nicely with gnome.rnrnI could write a PR once I know how this should be fixed.rnrnThanks in advance and have a nice day ;-)"

Will check if insync is okay with this, similar how I've checked that they are okay with the folder icon we have: https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru/issues/759#issuecomment-439012243&quot;</p> ]]></description>

How can i migrate existing user dir to zsys?

I have a dpool/home/hcw home folder migrated into a fresh ubuntu 20.04 install
by putting that data under rpool/USERDATA/home/hcw.
However, userdata does not seem to work for that new dataset.

zsysctrl show does only show the ubuntu-created users (there i had created a user hcw, but renamed / moved the dataset).



<strong>To Reproduce</strong>
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install ubuntu 20.04 via &quot;zfs root install&quot; expert / experimental option
2. Create a user &quot;hcw&quot; during install.
3. After install move the rpool/USERDATA/hcw_9y5x50 away by changing the mountpoint.
3. After install copy the other pools dpool/home/hcw to rpool/USERDATA/home/hcw (also create rpool/USERDATA/home).

<strong>Expected behavior</strong>
A documentation should exist how zsys detects user data and how to set up to migrate existing user datasets.

	<description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Describe the bug</strong>
loglevel changes via <code>zsysctl service loglevel</code> only affect the currently running daemon. This is helpful for debugging problems with manually triggered calls. Unfortunately, since zsysd is socket activated, it goes away fairly quickly, which resets the loglevel back to the 0 (wa
ing). 

Ideally I would like the loglevel to be configurable persistently, perhaps via /etc/zsys.conf
This would greatly facilitate the debugging of timer triggered calls. It would also enable an administrator to search logs for details on actions taken by zsys easily, without having to inspect the <code>zpool history</code> or inspecting the current state and comparing creation times.

<strong>To Reproduce</strong>
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run <code>zsysctl service loglevel 1</code>
2. Wait for next timer to trigger: zsys-gc.timer or zsys-user-savestate.timer
3. Check logs: <code>jou
alctl -u zsysd</code>
4. No interesting log entries found for that trigger

<strong>Expected behavior</strong>
I would have liked to see the loglevel persist at least a little longer than a minute or so. 

<strong>For ubuntu users, please run and copy the following:</strong>
1. <code>ubuntu-bug zsys --save=/tmp/report</code>

	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Add a &quot;demote&quot; command to convert a manual state save into an automatic state save.

The use case is that manual saves are taken into account when satisfying the garbage collection policies, and so deleting a manual save may cause unwanted gaps in the time line. But the user should not have to think about that sort of thing when cleaning up. So, it is better to just ask zsys to convert it to an automatic save. From that point zsys can delete it if it's superfluous, or keep it around if needed to satisfy the GC policy.

For example, suppose this time line, where the GC policy says to keep three saves, and currently there are two automatic saves (a) and one manual save (m):
-----------a---------------a-----------------------------m------------------------&gt; (time)
I may decide I don't need that manual save anymore for whatever purpose I made it originally. However, deleting it would lead to this time line:
-----------a---------------a------------------------------------------------------&gt; (time)
This no longer satisfies the policy and leaves a pretty big gap. So, it is not what I actually want.

If the manual save is simply demoted instead, it would lead to this time line:
-----------a---------------a-----------------------------a------------------------&gt; (time)
And all is still well. For now it is kept, and zsys will eventually delete it when it becomes too old.



There should also be a &quot;promote&quot; command, to tu
 an automatic save into a manual save, preventing it from being garbage collected.

The use case for this is when the user notices something has gone wrong but needs time to investigate and decide what to do.

For example, suppose I notice late in the day that some files I was working on got corrupted. And the snapshot made automatically two hours ago is fine, although of course older.

At this point I would not want to revert the entire system, as it's running fine and lots of other things happened (I do not want to revert the state of my browser or rss client for example, if that isn't necessary).

</code>

<strong>Expected behavior</strong>
<code>zsysctl save -s</code> should create snapshots for datasets from both <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code> and <code>dpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code>. I tried associating <code>dpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code> with <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code> using <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> property, but it did not result in snapshots being taken as expected.

<code>adduser</code> should create user home under <code>dpool/USERDATA</code>. Snapshots for <code>dpool/USERDATA/rejsmont_ch3gdz</code> are taken as expected though (thanks to <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> property).

When I did zsysctl save it told me that there is no association for that user and did some autosave of the old filesystem.

But there is the encrypted file system and its mount point is the home of the user.
How do I associate a zfs with a user, so that zsysctl knows what to do?

Even more fun - and I did not try it yet: ubuntu does not create new zfs for new users but just creates new home-directories under /home which is in rpool/USERDATA thus they will not be able to save their homes. But that is a problem of ubuntu.&quot;</p> ]]></description>

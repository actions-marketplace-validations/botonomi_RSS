<item>	<title>license yaml format issue</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/758</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>The <code>using</code> part of the license.txt looks weird to me. It’s an array of single-element map like this<br><code>yaml<br>using:<br>  - youtube-dl: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/LICENSE<br>  - kakoune: https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/UNLICENSE<br>  - RDF.rb: https://github.com/ruby-rdf/rdf/blob/master/UNLICENSE<br></code><br>why not just use a single map like this<br><code>yaml<br>using:<br>  youtube-dl: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/LICENSE<br>  kakoune: https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/UNLICENSE<br>  RDF.rb: https://github.com/ruby-rdf/rdf/blob/master/UNLICENSE<br></code><br>or an array of structered map<br><code>yaml<br>using:<br>  - name: youtube-dl<br>    url: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/LICENSE<br>  - name: kakoune<br>    url: https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/UNLICENSE<br>  - name: RDF.rb<br>    url: https://github.com/ruby-rdf/rdf/blob/master/UNLICENSE<br></code><br>It makes the deserialise code boilerplate, for e.g in Rust I have to declare this field like <br><code>Rust<br>using: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;&gt;,<br></code><br>When using this <code>using</code> field, I have to iterate the vector, during which I have to iterate the single-element map!<br>In other formats, it would be<br><code>Rust<br>using: Option&lt;HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;,<br></code><br>or<br><code>Rust<br>using: Option&lt;Vec&lt;SomeStruct&gt;&gt;,<br></code>"</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Test that license texts match SPDX plain license texts</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/636</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>We should have a test that each license text in <code>_licenses</code> is the same as the plain text license in the SPDX collection to automate the requirement described at https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-license<br><br>&gt; The text of the license should match the corresponding text found in <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/blob/master/text/">spdx/license-list-data</a>. If there are errors there, please fix them in <a href="https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML">spdx/license-list-XML</a> (from which the plain text version is generated) so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicense.com to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX.<br><br>The test could clone spdx/license-list-data and compare each license we have cataloged in this project. Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses. But we should address upfront for any new license cataloged here, and continue to chip away at the existing inconsistencies."</p> ]]></description>

See #67 and #62nnWe already have the bulk of the strings in a single file (<code>_config.yml</code>), so it should just be a matter of abstracting out some of our variables, as far as I can tell.nnWould love to take this on starting in August if there’s interest.

<item>	<title>Support for locally present bundles</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues/154</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I would like to run code-scanning with a custom code-scanning bundle<br>that already is present on my local disk. I can currently do that by<br>making the following hack:<br><br>### 1 Install bundle in tool cache:<br><br>Use <code>toolCache.cacheDir</code> to install the bundle with a specially crafted ID:<br><br><code>js<br>tc.cacheDir(localBundlePath, 'CodeQL', "0.0.0-XXX-DUMMY-BUNDLE-ID");<br></code><br><br>### 2 Convince codeql to look in the tool cache:<br><br>The codeql action is then invoked with a dummy URL that will make codeql.ts lookup the bundle with the specially crafted ID:<br><br><code>yaml<br>        ...<br>        tools: dummy://codeql-bundle-XXX-DUMMY-BUNDLE-ID/dummy<br>        ...<br></code><br><br>—<br><br>This works, but I would like a more reliable solution. I am not sure<br>what the best approach is for supporting my use case, but I am happy<br>to look into implementing a suggestion.<br>"</p> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Continuing from #4506. 49<item>	<title>Proposal: Make triaging more welcoming to external contributors</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/4982</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I’ve contributed on and off to linguist since 2017 and over time I’ve observed a quite frustrating patte<br> with issues and pull requests: legitimate issues and pull requests get labelled quite quickly as stale (30 days) and then closed (60), with no further option to reopen them.<br><br>I understand that this workflow may be convenient for maintainers, but it seems discouraging in a few ways:<br><br>- For a casual contributor, 60 days may be a too strict deadline for a Pull Request. It is quite frustrating to come back at a Pull Request a couple of months later (holidays or whatever reason for inactivity) to find you need to create a new one. <br><br>- For issues, closing an issue just because there is no PR in 60 days hides them from people who are looking for active ways to contribute. It also tends to promote filing duplicates without reading any of the previous discussion.<br><br>I think this could be improved in a way that promotes exte<br>al contributions while maintaining convenience for maintainers. There are probably many good ways, but I’m thinking about something along the following lines:<br><br>- Pull Requests: Do not close them automatically (or extend the grace period). There’s 73 PRs closed as Stale over a ~2 years period. A few of them were mostly ready, so the project could probably benefit from keeping them alive for a while.<br><br>- Issues: Once an issue is confirmed to be a valid bug or feature request, add a label (e.g. <code>Help Wanted</code>) and exclude it from the Stale workflow. This label would be a great way for people looking to contribute, while making it clear to the reporter that it needs someone to work on it. Keeping them open and clearly marked also makes them more easily discoverable by users experiencing the same issue, so they can contribute to the discussion.<br><br>What do you think?"</p> ]]></description>

I have a test branch for macOS at:<br>https://github.com/github/smimesign/tree/macos-build<br><br>This is not a high priority for us, but if someone took the time to migrate and debug the CI files for GH Actions it would help us maintain this project!"</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Don't connect to kext when invoked with CLI args</title>

This also happens when the app is launched from the command line (Eg. for deleting/listing registrations). If the app is already running in the background we’ll get an error because the kext only allows one connection. This error is surfaced to the user, which is confusing.

<item>	<title>Prettier for JavaScript and TypeScript</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/super-linter/issues/175</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>IIUC, super-linter uses ESLint and Standard to format JavaScript and TypeScript code rather than Prettier. I think many developers will have an issue with this. Despite the name, Standard is not a standard. It’s developers just gave it that name. For the past few years the trend has been to use ESLint only to check for issues and to use Prettier for formatting.<br><br>Most developers will be fine with most of the formatting that Standard performs. However, there is one controversial thing that it does. It enforces a space after function names in their definition. For example:<br><br><code>js<br>function myName (param1, param2) {<br>  ...<br>)<br></code><br><br>I think you will find that almost no JavaScript developer does this. So using Standard will make this change across their code bases and they will not like it.<br><br>Please reconsider the use of Standard for JavaScript formatting and instead use Prettier, which is by far the more popular option.<br>"</p> ]]></description>

	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/pull/240</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>In Rails, when you create a form it saves a reference to the current<br>template object that is rendering the form. When you render a form<br>builder helper method, like <code>form.label</code> inside of a child component the<br>template object will be the original template object from where the form<br>builder was instantiated.<br><br>This means in cases where we pass a block to a form builder helper the<br><code>@output_buffer</code> is the parent component’s output buffer. So when that<br>buffer is overridden via <code>.capture</code> it’s setting the parent component’s<br><code>@output_buffer</code> to a new, temporary buffer but it doesn’t change the<br>child component that is actually rendering’s <code>@output_buffer</code>. This<br>means the block is executed in the context of the child components<br>actual <code>@output_buffer</code> and immediately writes to the buffer. Since<br><code>capture</code> had nothing written to the temporary buffer, it retu<br>s the<br>value of the block call and then inserts that into the parent<br>component’s <code>@output_buffer</code>.<br><br>This resolves the issue by monkey patching <code>ActionView::Base</code> to support<br>a new <code>child_component</code> attribute and overriding <code>output_buffer=</code> to set<br>its <code>child_component</code>s output_buffer to whatever <code>output_buffer</code> is set<br>to. With that in place, when <code>capture</code> is called, then #output_buffer=`<br>is called which will update the child component’s output buffer to the new <br>temporary buffer correctly."</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Moving away from TaskCluster</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3317</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>TaskCluster is a CI service provided by Mozilla, and available to both Firefox development (Firefox-CI instance) and Community on Github (Community TaskCluster). It’s being widely used across some Mozilla projects, and it has its own advantages. In our case, the control over tasks, over workers for specific needs and long build time was easier to achieve working with the TaskCluster team rather than relying on other CI services.<br><br>However, this has lead to the CI code being very specific to the project, and kind of a source of frustration for non employees trying to send patches and get involved in the project ; specifically because some of the CI parts were “hand-crafted” and triggering builds and tests requires being a “collaborator” on the Github project, which has other implications making it complicated to enable it easily to anyone. In the end, this creates an artificial barrier to contributing to this project, even though we happily run PRs manually, it is still frustrating for everyone. The issue https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3228 was an attempt to fix that, but we came to the conclusion it would be more beneficial for everyone to switch to some well known CI service and setup that is less intimidating. While TaskCluster is a great tool and has helped us a lot, we feel its limitations now makes it inappropriate for the project to stimulate and enable exte<br>al contributions.<br><br>We would like to take this opportunity to also enable more contributors to hack and own the code related to CI, so discussion is open.<br>"</p> ]]></description>

	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3175</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I run into the error “Invalid label 0”. I assume it is from the function <code>Alphabet::DecodeSingle()</code> in the file <code>native_client/alphabet.cc</code>.<br><br>I don’t know why I am running into this error and it is not important for now. What is important is the fact that the code calls <code>abort()</code> just after printing this error.<br><br>I don’t know your guidelines.

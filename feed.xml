	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I see that this website uses pixel values on "application.scss" file. I suggest to convert pixel values used for fonts and spacing to relative fonts like "rem’" or "em". This will lead to accessibility of the site and rank higher on Google.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></pre> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Would love to see about baking in I18N support to choosealicense.com proper. See #67 and #62</p>
<p>We already have the bulk of the strings in a single file (<code>_config.yml</code>), so it should just be a matter of abstracting out some of our variables, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Would love to take this on starting in August if there’s interest. Would be a great exercise to set a standard for Jekyll L10N, and can iterate on some of the lessons learned form https://github.com/CMSgov/healthcare.gov.</p>

<p>Some mention that codeowners file paths are case sensitive, even if developing on case insensitive systems. I’ve seen this in other articles, but I think it belongs in the official documentation.</p>
<p>It might also be good to list a few examples demonstrating the case sensitive behavior.</p>

<p>Remove duplicate content.</p>
<p>There is a duplicated statement in the description of the "private" field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either true to make the repository private or false to make it public. Default: false.
Note: You will get a 422 error if the organization restricts changing repository visibility to organization owners and a non-owner tries to change the value of private.

<p><sup>Originally posted by <strong>Andre601</strong> October 27, 2021</sup>
Just recently discovered that you can append <code>gh_color_mode=light</code> or <code>gh_color_mode=dark</code> to a githubusercontent.com hosted image to only show it while the user is using the respective mode.</p>
I feel like this should be mentioned in the docs somewhere, probably under the markdown syntax docs in the images section, so that people are aware of it.

<p>There’s a big warning in the linked page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use credentials that are minimally scoped:
<ul>
<li>Make sure the credentials being used within workflows have the least privileges required, and be mindful that any user with write access to your repository has read access to all secrets configured in your repository.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s really easy to read/skim past this the way the document is structured now.</p>
<p>I propose we add a new heading: <code>Strongly consider who you give write rights to</code> and
put the warning "Be mindful that any user with write access to your repository has read access to all secrets configured in your repository." in that section.</p>
<p>I suggest styling the warning message itself as a warning box with a red background, or something similar to really capture the attention of the reader.</p>

<p>Sometimes customers want to change their nameservers. They simply read <a href="https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.19/admin/installation/configuring-dns-nameservers#configuring-nameservers-using-the-administrative-shell">Configuring DNS nameservers</a> and start making changes to the <em>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head</em> file. We have seen some cases where customers just remove this:</p>
<pre><code>nameserver 127.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>And got a ton of <code>500</code> errors after restarting <code>resolvconf</code>.</p>
<p>This is warned in the <em>/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head</em> file:</p>
<pre><code># DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE DIRECTLY. YOUR MODIFICATIONS WILL BE OVERWRITTEN.
#
# For static IP configurations, nameservers can be specified via `ghe-setup-network&#39;.
# For DHCP configurations, nameservers are auto-populated with values provided in the DHCP lease.
# To add custom options to this file, edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head and run `sudo service resolvconf restart&#39;.
#
# The 127.0.0.1 entry is *required* to be the first entry in the list here. Removing it
# or having another entry as the first entry will break GitHub Enterprise. It&#39;s also not
# supported to add options that affect the ordering here such as \&quot;options rotate\&quot;.</code></pre>
<p>But the same content should be documented. Ideally we should have something like this:</p>

<p>The section "Configuring a service account and storing its credentials" has this call documented:</p>
<pre><code> gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GKE_PROJECT \
  --member=serviceAccount:$SA_EMAIL \
  --role=roles/container.admin \
  --role=roles/storage.admin \
  --role=roles/container.clusterViewer</code></pre>
<p>But it seems that <code>add-iam-policy-binding</code> can only take one <code>--role</code> argument at a time.</p>
<p>For instance, this will cause a failure during <code>docker push</code>:</p>
<pre><code>denied: Token exchange failed for project &#39;***&#39;. Caller does not have permission &#39;storage.buckets.get&#39;. To configure permissions, follow instructions at: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control</code></pre>
<p>The example given is otherwise able to correctly auth with gcloud, configure docker, and get credentials for the GKE cluster, but then fails to push to <code>gcr.io</code>.</p>
<p>Looking through the output of <code>add-iam-policy-binding</code>, the new service account is only listed in the <code>role: roles/container.clusterViewer</code> section.</p>
<p>It seems that whatever the last <code>--role</code> given to <code>add-iam-policy-binding</code> is the role that will actually be applied to the binding without an error.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p><strong>What feature or product is affected?</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Enterprise Server.</p>
<p><strong>What is the new or expected behavior?</strong></p>
<p>It’d be good to include some advice for increasing hardware resources available to GitHub Enterprise Server instances in Azure or Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p><strong>How is the old or inaccurate behavior currently documented?</strong></p>
<p>Per https://github.com/github/docs-internal/pull/17498#discussion_r566528908, "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/enterprise-management/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources">Increasing CPU or memory resources</a>" only addresses GitHub Enterprise Server instances hosted on AWS, KVM, and VMware. It’d be nice to include instructions for increasing resources for instances hosted on Azure and Google Cloud Platform, or at least write a blurb at the top of the page with any known limitations or high-level instructions. (We link to this article from the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance">various articles on installing GitHub Enterprise Server</a>, so right now, administrators on Azure and Google Cloud Platform might end up at this article, but they won’t see any instructions for their hypervisor.)</p>
<p><strong>Who does this affect?</strong></p>
<p>Administrators of GitHub Enterprise Server using Azure or Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p><strong>What is the impact to users?</strong></p>
<p>Folks might contact support for instructions. Since GitHub doesn’t own Azure or Google Cloud Platform, sometimes we then have to point the customer to other documentation, so it’s potentially a frustrating adventure to find the information that you need for upgrading the virtual machine you’re running 😅</p>

<p>An explanation of how to view raw documents would be useful. I tried searching docs for <code>raw</code> and can’t find anything</p>
<p>There’s a widget in many pages for this:

But, it doesn’t appear to actually be documented. This leads to users reporting:</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a section about transferring action repositories and another about some finer details regarding the marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repo can be transferred and actions will continue to work because there is a redirect in place (users of the action won’t have to update their workflows)</li>

From the former:
&gt; If a team has enabled code review assignments, the individual approvals won’t satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For more information, see "Managing code review assignment for your team."</p>
<p>From the latter:
&gt; When code owners are automatically requested for review, the team is still removed and replaced with individuals. The individual approvals don’t satisfy the requirement for code owner approval in a protected branch. For more information, see "About code owners."</p>
<p>Based on our internal testing, <strong>this is no longer correct.</strong> The team is not removed from the PR, and the round robin reviewer can approve the PR successfully. Additionally, if code review assignment is enabled and set not to notify the team, only the single reviewer will be requested as intended.</p>

<p>Every change to an <code>#anchor</code> name for endpoint titles requires a change in the code, due to the error handlers which include a URL to the documentation. The endpoint titles are more prone to changes, while operation IDs should be changed much less frequently, as they are consider a breaking change to some of the OpenAPI consumers, while the <code>\"summary\"</code> key is not.</p>
<p>The problem with the title changes might also be amplified once translations are introduced.</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Any interest in supporting F#?</p>
<p>We have our own compiler APIs that enable all kinds of stuff based on structure and semantics; and it’s part of the compiler proper, not some janky thing that breaks because the compiler changed stuff. You can see this in the Fable REPL, which supports a wide range of tooling features in the editor: https://fable.io/repl/</p>
<p>Based on looking at how you do things, you wouldn’t be able to use this directly, which would imply a lot of work. F# syntax and semantic aren’t trivial 😅. But if there was a way to extend this to allow the existing tooling support (which can run in a browser!), then we might be able to prioritize stuff on the F# side of things to make it easier.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<p>Hello, how could this be done? In the javascript documentation the configuration needed to use webpack is indicated, but I am interested in using stimulus using importmap and sprockets, as it will be in rails 7 by default, using the asset pipeline.</p>
<p>Could this be added to the documentation?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How have y’all at Github approached testing view components that have an interactive component to them? We’ve mainly been unit testing each view component we add and then writing feature specs for browser interactions, but I’m wondering if there is a better way to approach it - RailsConf Q&amp;A</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h3>
<p>In Primer ViewComponents, we use system tests powered by cuprite and ViewComponent Previews for testing behaviors. As this approach matures, we should aim to move of much of it as possible into ViewComponent.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<!-- Provide a summary of the behavior. -->
<p>Allow refactoring small view parts into a separate view, and be able to <code>render</code> them into the template. These views should not be available outside the component.</p>
<pre><code>app/components/my_component/my_component.html.erb
app/components/my_component/a_part.html.erb</code></pre>
<pre class="erb"><code>&lt;%# my_component.html.erb %&gt;
&lt;%= render &#39;a_part&#39; %&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to separate a sub-component from the component. For example, if I want to render a popover with extra info about a particular model, I would want to extract that popover into a separate view.</p>
<p>Alternative Solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extract a new component. Because the popover is not a generic one to be used in other parts of the application, it doesn’t make much sense to create a (now public) component for it.</li>
<li>Use <code>content_for</code>. This is not suitable if the partial needs to take arguments. In my example, it wouldn’t work if I’m displaying a list of models and I want to show the popover for each model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prior art:
ActionView does support partials, of course.
Cells does allow multiple views per cell, and allows using <code>render view: 'a_part'</code>.</p>
<h3 id="possible-solutions-i-see">Possible solutions I see</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provide a method that prefixes the component dir and then goes on to call <code>render template:</code> with the full path. I would suspect this is relatively slow given that <code>render</code> is slow in ActionView.</li>
<li>Precompile all the templates into methods with a reserved prefix, and allow calling them from the view. For example, using <code>extra_views_{view_name}</code>.</li>
</ol></pre> ]]></description>

<p>It makes the deserialise code boilerplate, for e.g in Rust I have to declare this field like</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>using<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">Option</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="dt">Vec</span><span class="op">&lt;</span>HashMap<span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="dt">String</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">String</span><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;,</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When using this <code>using</code> field, I have to iterate the vector, during which I have to iterate the single-element map!
In other formats, it would be</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>using<span class="op">:</span> <span class="dt">Option</span><span class="op">&lt;</span>HashMap<span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="dt">String</span><span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">String</span><span class="op">&gt;&gt;,</span></span></code></pre></div>

This also happens when the app is launched from the command line (Eg. for deleting/listing registrations). If the app is already running in the background we’ll get an error because the kext only allows one connection. This error is surfaced to the user, which is confusing. We should not connect to the kext unless we need to.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Following the guidance of github, many developers are moving to <code>main</code> as their default branch. Saving developers from the very small hindrance of using <code>DEFAULT_BRANCH: main</code> would contribute to smoothing the transition.</p>

<item>	<title>Access request within SlotComponent instance</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/409</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <h2 id="feature-request">Feature request</h2>
<p>https://github.com/github/view_component/pull/59 added context and access to the request object within the component, however this does not seem to extend to SlotComponent.
I would like to propose this change to SlotComponents also</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I would like to use an active nav anchor tag in a NavItem slot within a NavBarComponent, by using the request to determine the <code>current_page?</code> Currently I having to work around this by wrapping the SlotComponent instance in a method in the parent Component and calling the method from the template.
To me the SlotComponents should have access to the same helpers and view context that the parent components currently provide.</p>
<p>I will attempt a PR of this myself if there’s acceptance and motivation to do so.</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Fix rendering of components that utilize `capture` in a parent view context</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/pull/240</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>In Rails, when you create a form it saves a reference to the current
template object that is rendering the form. When you render a form
builder helper method, like <code>form.label</code> inside of a child component the
template object will be the original template object from where the form
builder was instantiated.</p>
<p>This means in cases where we pass a block to a form builder helper the
<code>@output_buffer</code> is the parent component’s output buffer. So when that
buffer is overridden via <code>.capture</code> it’s setting the parent component’s
<code>@output_buffer</code> to a new, temporary buffer but it doesn’t change the
child component that is actually rendering’s <code>@output_buffer</code>. This
means the block is executed in the context of the child components
actual <code>@output_buffer</code> and immediately writes to the buffer. Since
<code>capture</code> had nothing written to the temporary buffer, it returns the
value of the block call and then inserts that into the parent
component’s <code>@output_buffer</code>.</p>
<p>This resolves the issue by monkey patching <code>ActionView::Base</code> to support
a new <code>child_component</code> attribute and overriding <code>output_buffer=</code> to set
its <code>child_component</code>s output_buffer to whatever <code>output_buffer</code> is set
to. With that in place, when <code>capture</code> is called, then #output_buffer=`
is called which will update the child component’s output buffer to the new
temporary buffer correctly.</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Moving away from TaskCluster</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3317</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>TaskCluster is a CI service provided by Mozilla, and available to both Firefox development (Firefox-CI instance) and Community on Github (Community TaskCluster). It’s being widely used across some Mozilla projects, and it has its own advantages. In our case, the control over tasks, over workers for specific needs and long build time was easier to achieve working with the TaskCluster team rather than relying on other CI services.</p>
<p>However, this has lead to the CI code being very specific to the project, and kind of a source of frustration for non employees trying to send patches and get involved in the project ; specifically because some of the CI parts were “hand-crafted” and triggering builds and tests requires being a “collaborator” on the Github project, which has other implications making it complicated to enable it easily to anyone. In the end, this creates an artificial barrier to contributing to this project, even though we happily run PRs manually, it is still frustrating for everyone. The issue https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3228 was an attempt to fix that, but we came to the conclusion it would be more beneficial for everyone to switch to some well known CI service and setup that is less intimidating. While TaskCluster is a great tool and has helped us a lot, we feel its limitations now makes it inappropriate for the project to stimulate and enable external contributions.</p>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to also enable more contributors to hack and own the code related to CI, so discussion is open.</p> ]]></description>

<p>If you’ve found a bug, or have a feature request, then please create an issue with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have I written custom code (as opposed to running examples on an unmodified clone of the repository)</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)</strong>: Android R (API 30)</li>
<li><strong>Exact command to reproduce</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>I modified the STT-example in Kotlin for use in a Mozilla-STT React Native module I’m building. However, running streaming transcription uses more and more memory until the app crashes. See a fully working example by cloning <a href="https://github.com/zaptrem/react-native-transcription">this repo</a>, running <code>yarn bootstrap</code>, then <code>yarn example android</code>. Attach to it using the Android Studio profiler to watch the memory usage creep upwards.</p>
<p>Implementation: https://github.com/zaptrem/react-native-transcription/blob/master/android/src/main/java/com/reactnativetranscription/TranscriptionModule.kt</p>
<p>Please describe the problem clearly. Be sure to convey here why it’s a bug or a feature request.</p>
<p>Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. For larger logs, link to a Gist, not a screenshot. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Try to provide a reproducible test case.</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Change Alphabet::EncodeSingle and Alphabet::DecodeSingle to use an outparam and return an error code instead of calling `abort`</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3175</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I run into the error "Invalid label 0". I assume it is from the function <code>Alphabet::DecodeSingle()</code> in the file <code>native_client/alphabet.cc</code>.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I am running into this error and it is not important for now. What is important is the fact that the code calls <code>abort()</code> just after printing this error.</p>
<p>I don’t know your guidelines. But I can tell that aborting the whole process, including the python interpreter which might be interactive, is a terrible way of handling errors, especially in such a trivial function, and I call it a bug.</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>No working download links found for ds_ctcdecoder==training/deepspeech_training/VERSION</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3099</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello,</p>
<p>when I trie to use the <code>setup.py</code> on from <code>version 0.7.4</code> it always calls this error:</p>
<p><code>No local packages or working download links found for ds_ctcdecoder==training/deepspeech_training/VERSION error:  Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('ds_ctcdecoder==training/deepspeech_training/VERSION')</code></p>
<p>With the <code>version 0.7.3</code> and older it finds the ds_ctcdecoder but always calls that I need <code>numpy</code> in <code>version 1.16</code>, when I install 1.16 it calls me that I need <code>numpy 1.13.3</code> because of other modules and so on. That’s why I think my only chance to use DeepSpeech is with the newest version.</p>
<p>I’m on windwos 10 with python 3.6.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>getting very bad transcript while live streaming on r0.6 version node js socket api</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech-examples/issues/66</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi,
I have trained my custom model DeepSpeech 0.6.1 on my own data from scratch.</p>
<p>I have getting good accuracy while inference using deepspeech binary (testing wer: 0.18).</p>
<p>When i try r0.6 node js socket api and also mic vad streaming using my own data and lm, I am getting very bad transcript.</p>
<p>It does not capture any word, it just give me an output of same garbage word for each and every spoken word.</p>
<p>My predicted transcripts:</p>
<p>haan
haan haan
haan haan haan …</p>
<p>I saved recorded audio and listen it was of very good quality and when i infer trans from deepspeech binary using the command:
deepspeech –model model_path –lm lm_path –trie trie_path –audio audio_path</p>
<p>It gives me very good transcripts.</p>
<p>So I am not able to understand why this happens with r0.6.
when I test with 0.5.1 model example of mic vad streaming, then I am getting good accuracy.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me to resolve this.
Why I am getting bad transcript on r0.6 node js socket api as well as mic vad streaming.</p>
<p>Thanks</p> ]]></description>

After I run node start.js , nothing happened.
Do i need to specify to specific port first?
If so, can I use socketio protocol, to send the transcribed text over to client?</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Make the set of syncable roots configurable</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/dogear/issues/51</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>We currently hard-code syncable to mean "everything under the five built-in roots". This works for <span class="citation" data-cites="eoger">@eoger</span>’s use case (filtering out <code>readinglist</code> and <code>pinned</code> when importing bookmarks from Fennec), and it wouldn’t be much more work to make them customizable.</p>
<p>I imagine we’d add a method like <code>Builder::syncable(vec![MENU_GUID, MOBILE_GUID, TOOLBAR_GUID, UNFILED_GUID])</code>, store the list of syncable roots on the tree, and check them in <code>Node::is_syncable</code>.</p>
<p>While we’re at it, we could also generalize our special handling for tags on Desktop—they’re part of the merged tree (so not deleted), but never uploaded. Or we can leave it and wait for tags to move to a separate table, which we already do in Rust Places. 😁</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Train a better Speaker Encoder</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/512</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Our current <strong>speaker encoder</strong> is trained with only LibriTTS (100, 360) datasets. However, we can improve its performance using other available datasets (VoxCeleb, LibriTTS-500, Common Voice etc.). It will also increase the performance of<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OX2jtyxmeFt7kRO65QgPy65ku6HWUrFK?usp=sharing">our multi-speaker model</a> and makes it easier to adapt to new voices.</p>
<p>I can’t really work on this alone due to the recent changes and the amount of work needed therefore <strong>I need some hand</strong> here to work together.</p>
<p>So I can list the TODO as follows and feel free to contribute to any part of it or suggest changes;</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
decide target datasets</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
download and preprocess the datasets</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
write preprocessors for new datasets</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
increase the efficiency of the speaker encoder data-loader.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
training a model only using Eng datasets.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
training a model with all the available datasets.</li>

<p>I am not willing to invest time in it given the way faster alternatives but you can let us know if you like to see WaveRNN as a part of Mozilla TTS repo.</p>

<item>	<title>[HELP] Share your trained TTS models?</title>
	<link>https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/issues/395</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Please consider sharing your pre-trained models in any language (If the licenses allow that). We can include them in our model catalog for public use by referencing your name (website, company etc.).</p>
<p>That would enable more people experiment together and coordinate, instead of individual efforts to achieve similar goals. That is also a good chance to make your work more visible.</p> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Would love to see about baking in I18N support to choosealicense.com proper. See #67 and #62</p>
<p>We already have the bulk of the strings in a single file (<code>_config.yml</code>), so it should just be a matter of abstracting out some of our variables, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Would love to take this on starting in August if there’s interest. Would be a great exercise to set a standard for Jekyll L10N, and can iterate on some of the lessons learned form https://github.com/CMSgov/healthcare.gov.</p>

<item>	<title>Confusing example in Syncing a Fork</title>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>In step 5 of this section, the example shows</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Merge the changes from the upstream default branch - in this case, <code>upstream/main</code> - into your local default branch. This brings your fork’s default branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ git merge upstream/main
Updating a422352..5fdff0f
Fast-forward
README                    |    9 -------
README.md                 |    7 ++++++
2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
delete mode 100644 README
create mode 100644 README.md</code></pre>
<p>If your local branch didn’t have any unique commits, Git will instead perform a "fast-forward":
<code>shell  $ git merge upstream/main Updating 34e91da..16c56ad Fast-forward  README.md                 |    5 +++--  1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problematic line is <strong><em>Git will instead perform a "fast-forward"</em></strong>. This suggests that the immediately prior example was <em>not</em> a fast-forward, in contrast to the example about to be shown. But the output from the first example clearly shows that it too was a fast-forward!</p>
<p>If two supposedly contrasting examples are to be shown, then they really should be <em>contrasting</em> (with regard to whether or not the merge was a fast forward). Alternatively, only a single example could be given, perhaps with a comment about what sort of merge was performed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can only delete issues in a repository owned by your personal account. You cannot delete issues in a repository owned by another personal account, even if you are a collaborator there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read that first sentence as meaning "it is not at all possible to delete issues that are not in personal accounts"</p>
<p>I’d suggest changing the paragraph to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an issue is in a personal account, you can only delete it if it is your personal account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If an issue is in a personal account, it can only be deleted by that account’s owner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that collaborators are things. But, I’m not sure that mentioning them is relevant if the wording is sufficiently clear. – the second form would probably give space to mention collaborators if someone felt a real need.</p>

<item>	<title>Ambiguous example for `registry_package` workflow trigger</title>

<h3 id="what-article-on-docs.github.com-is-affected">What article on docs.github.com is affected?</h3>
<p>From https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#registry_package</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you can run a workflow when a package has been <code>published</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>could be updated to something more descriptive, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, you can run a workflow when a new package version has been <code>published</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would also be helpful to further elaborate how the action types are triggered here:
- https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#package</p>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>Given the description for <code>action</code> types of a <code>registry_package</code> event:
https://github.com/github/docs/blob/07f59b3aa85b19085290a9ac7dce62c54667b74f/data/reusables/webhooks/package_properties.md?plain=1#L3</p>
<p>And the following example:
https://github.com/github/docs/blob/4263e058437f9ae6c525d2134a04d5ad99df704d/content/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows.md?plain=1#L1022</p>
<p>I would’ve expected <code>published</code> to act as a trigger for a <strong>new</strong> npm registry package being <strong>created</strong>. The use case being running a script only once in a package monorepo for any newly created package.</p>
<p>Instead, the <code>published</code> action is dispatched whenever a new version of a package is published, which includes the behavior I would’ve expected for <code>updated</code>.</p>
<p>At this time I haven’t been able to trigger <code>updated</code> actions to understand what differentiates it or what scenarios it supports. Perhaps another section of the docs that could be expanded.</p>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>The current "recommended" mitigation to script injections in GitHub workflows is to use a GitHub Action, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-an-action-instead-of-an-inline-script-recommended</p>
<p>I think this is mis-leading. All this recommendation is doing is tell users to use an action, basically moving the vulnerability inside the action instead of the workflow itself.</p>
<p>As a user, I may create a local Action and introduce the exact same vulnerability using a script, which is not going to mitigate the problem. If the intention is to say "don’t use a script and use javascript, possibly inside an Action", I think that would be fine. But the way it’s phrased right now is mis-leading. Using an Action does <em>not</em> mitigate script injections.</p>
<p>A drawback of GHA is that it’s yet another dependency to maintain and another attack surface.</p>
<p>The right way to fix this vulnerability is to declare an env variable, which is given as a second option. Users worried about script injection in their script are <em>unlikely</em> to move to an Action, which takes additional work. Users use inline scripts because it’s the easy option, so I think we should meet them where they’re at.</p>

<h3 id="what-changes-are-you-suggesting">What changes are you suggesting?</h3>
<p>The PR template instructs me to some things that don’t sound right, it may be just outdated terminology. Before addressing any of that in an actual PR I’m raising these for discussion:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>"changes in staging (look for "Automatically generated comment" and click <strong>Modified</strong> to view your latest changes"
<ul>
<li>I don’t see anything "Modified" in the comment; there’s a separate deployment timeline event, and the comment contains only "Preview", "Production" and empty "What’s changed". Nothing more there to click. 🤷‍♂️
Was this meant to be something that’s not there all the time, or has been removed/replaced?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The PR intro mentions linking a PR, that sounds like a place for referencing an issue to me, so maybe:</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode diff"><code class="sourceCode diff"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="st">-By explaining why you&#39;re making a change (or linking to a pull request) and what changes you&#39;ve made, …</span></span>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The "local" links to <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and <code>types-of-contributions.md</code> don’t work in the context of a <code>/compare…</code> URL where the preview for new PR is being displayed, i. e. these two need to be converted to absolute like the others in the template.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll happily fix it if that’s ok to touch the template file…</p>

<p>I have noticed recently that wrapping color in markdown code syntax renders the color. I’m not sure if this is new behavior, but either way, I don’t believe this is documented anywhere. I thought it was cool, and it would be nice to have this documented.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure the best location to put this. You can see my suggestions above, but I don’t think this is extensive enough to have its own page? I wouldn’t mind writing and opening a PR documenting this, but I first would love some feedback as to where this would be best placed. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using the specific major action version allows you to receive critical fixes and security patches while still maintaining compatibility. It also assures that your workflow should still work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section can be read to imply that GitHub Actions understands semantic versioning, but it does not. In order for users to specify a major action version, the action maintainer has to tag it themselves. It would be good to clarify that tagging a major version only works if the maintainer chooses to support it. In my personal opinion, the risks of being broken by a bad release outweigh the benefits of always using the latest version of an action (at a specified major version). I would suggest pinning a specific version and using Dependabot to keep up-to-date instead.</p>

<h3 id="what-changes-are-you-suggesting">What changes are you suggesting?</h3>
<p>The existing documentation for file syntax does not make it explicitly clear that a pattern can only be specified once, and that if &gt;1 instance of a pattern is present, the last instance will take precedence.</p>
<p>For example the following example would only request review from <code>@doctocat</code>, <code>@octocat</code> would not be included in the reviewers.</p>
<pre><code>apps/ @octocat
apps/ @doctocat</code></pre>
<p>I would propose that a line be added to the <code>CODEOWNERS syntax</code> section indicating that a repeated pattern is not supported.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>Additionally, I believe an issue should be raised internally against the validation of codeowners files - the above example will be marked as valid by the CODEOWNERS validation, and will not provide any indication to the end user that only the last instance of the pattern will be used.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<p>I’d like to see clarification around what it means for Octokit to be an official library and/or removal of octokit/octokit.js as an official library.</p>
<p>When Dependabot calls out a vulnerability in octokit.js, it being documented as "the official Octokit library" suggests GitHub will do things to address the vulnerability. I’d like to see this document clarify whether that’s the case.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>I read "the official Octokit library" in GitHub’s documentation to mean GitHub endorses and supports users’ use of Octokit, and may sponsor maintenance of the library’s projects. I struggle to imagine the official library being un-maintained.</p>

<p>YAML treats floats like <code>2.10</code> as <code>2.1</code>. This can lead to workflows using a different language version than intended. We should update the YAML examples to quote language versions to avoid this. To help users who copy-paste-modify without understanding the nuance, we should quote all language versions, even ones that would not be affected by this parsing.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]</code></pre>
<p>should be changed to</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [\&quot;3.6\&quot;, \&quot;3.7\&quot;, \&quot;3.8\&quot;, \&quot;3.9\&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Then if a user copies the example but wants to include version 3.10, they can easily plug in the new value without knowing they need to add quotes.</p>

<p>At present, it doesn’t seem that there’s any mention of the architectures (for example, x86, x64, armv7, arm64) that are supported.

<p>I’m looking to cross-reference the GitHub Hosted Actions Runners with a support matrix for a major open source project to consider migrating to Actions as our primary CI rather than a self-hosted Jenkins instance.

<p>I’ve already transferred a repository. The documentation states "All links to the previous repository location are automatically redirected to the new location.", which is working great. However, now I would like to know if I can create a fork back to the original account, without destroying those redirects.</p>
<p>Intuitively I would think, that the redirects will be lost entirely, when I would simply fork the repository, but it would be helpful if the docs could confirm this.</p>
<p>As a workaround to this, I am thinking about forking to a temporary account first, then renaming the repository (since it doesn’t seem possible to rename while forking), and then transferring the renamed repository to the original account. Before I do this I would like to be sure that the redirects will keep working for the original name, and I think similarly it would be helpful if the docs could include some information about this.</p>

<p>Remove duplicate content.</p>
<p>There is a duplicated statement in the description of the "private" field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either true to make the repository private or false to make it public. Default: false.
Note: You will get a 422 error if the organization restricts changing repository visibility to organization owners and a non-owner tries to change the value of private.

<p>When OpenSSH is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">installed using the Settings</a> (Window 10 build 1809 and later; or Windows Server 2019), the <code>ssh-agent</code> runs as a background system service rather than returning a stringified batch script that needs to be <code>eval</code>’d.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683092/how-to-run-ssh-add-on-windows#:~:text=Update%202019%20-%20A%20better%20solution%20if%20you%27re%20using%20Windows%2010%3A%20OpenSSH%20is%20available%20as%20part%20of%20Windows%2010%20which%20makes%20using%20SSH%20from%20cmd/powershell%20much%20easier%20in%20my%20opinion.%20It%20also%20doesn%27t%20rely%20on%20having%20git%20installed%2C%20unlike%20my%20previous%20solution.">2019 update to top answer on "How to run ssh-add on windows?"</a></p>
<p>This means that the status quo instructions promoting either <code>eval $(ssh-agent -s)</code> or <code>eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"</code> will not work for some users, but will also not provide useful output. For me, either above command does nothing in PowerShell or cmd.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>A succinct emendation is to recommend <code>Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Get-Process</code> in a PowerShell host to find the <code>ssh-agent</code> process ID.</p>
<p>A more detailed suggestion is to walk the reader through scrupulously determining what is providing <code>ssh-agent</code>, if anything.</p>

<item>	<title>Link to GitHub Classroom content in other docs articles</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/6738</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-article-on-docs.github.com-is-affected">What article on docs.github.com is affected?</h3>
<p>This could effect a variety of GitHub articles, since we want to add links in articles, where it makes sense, to GitHub Classroom articles.</p>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>Here are 4 examples of articles that could benefit from a link to GitHub Classroom articles:
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-template-repository">Creating a template repository</a>” - To this article about template repositories, we can add a link to this GitHub Classroom article “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-assignment-from-a-template-repository">Create an assignment from a template repository</a>” so that those learning how to create a template repository are aware they can be used in GitHub Classroom.
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment#creating-a-pull-request-for-feedback">Create an individual assignment</a>” - To this page in GitHub Classroom, the section “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment#creating-a-pull-request-for-feedback">Creating a pull request for feedback</a>” which is specifically about enabling feedback pull requests to be automatically created for each student submission, we can add a link to this article, “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests">Leave feedback with pull requests</a>” , which goes into more detail about how to leave feedback in those pull requests.
- To either “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/about-integrations">About integrations</a>” or “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/github-extensions-and-integrations">GitHub extensions and integrations</a>”, we can link out to “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide">Integrate GitHub Classroom with an IDE</a>”, in the context of giving an example of an integration with GitHub specific to education, allowing students to develop in an online IDE.
- This is a bit more vague, but we could add a link in some page about GitHub Actions, such as “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration">About continuous integration</a>” to “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/use-autograding">Use autograding</a>” as an example of one way continuous integration and GitHub Actions is used, in an education/classroom context.</p>
<p>There may be other articles out there that could also use links to GitHub Classroom articles (including GitHub Classroom articles themselves) - feel free to explore and find other places!</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>When you add the link, you would usually want to add it a new paragraph or a "Further reading" section if it doesn’t fit in any of the existing sections. When we link to other articles, we often start with "For more information, see [link]". In this case, you could also say something like "To see an example of how [feature] is used in GitHub Classroom, see [link]" - whatever wording makes clear why they might find it useful or of interest to go to that link.</p>

<p>Every change to an <code>#anchor</code> name for endpoint titles requires a change in the code, due to the error handlers which include a URL to the documentation.

<p>Could you help us to resolve the warning? Maybe some configuration needs to be applied? Also there is another question. Is it possible this skipping of cron job task to result in not updating user if there is new change in the LDAP group?</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Though FilePath is very flawed, especially on Windows, typed paths were a failed experiment. They did not actually catch any bugs; the best thing they did was expose some very weird behavior in certain functions, ones that we were unable to change (without huge renovations) lest command-line invocations break. There is a new FilePath type coming, one based on ShortByteString and officially blessed by a GHC working group, and we should just switch back to FilePath so that we can transition to that when possible.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>How to configure stimulus using the new rails 7 asset pipeline</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/1064</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h2 id="feature-request">Feature request</h2>
<p>Hello, how could this be done? In the javascript documentation the configuration needed to use webpack is indicated, but I am interested in using stimulus using importmap and sprockets, as it will be in rails 7 by default, using the asset pipeline.</p>
<p>Could this be added to the documentation?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>While we <em>do</em> share that ViewComponents don’t work well with <code>form_for</code>, this information is hard to find under <code>known issues</code>. There is no suggested alternative or approach.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h3>
<p>Add a <code>Forms</code> section to the guide:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Include existing disclaimer about <code>form_for</code> compatibility</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Add direction towards using <code>_tag</code> helpers (?)</li>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<p>As a consumer of ViewComponent, it can be difficult to understand the functional relationship between the component and template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are instance variables from the component accessible in the template?</li>
<li>What about instance methods?</li>
<li>Do instance methods need to be public to be accessible in the template?</li>
<li>What helpers are accessible?</li>
</ul>

<p>Add an explanation, potentially as an entirely new page? (<code>Encapsulation</code>?)</p></pre> ]]></description>

<p>I wrote https://github.com/joelhawksley/view-component-demo as an early demo of how to use ViewComponent. I don’t keep it up to date and it doesn’t showcase much of what ViewComponent can do.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h3>
<p>Provide a demo Rails application that showcases ViewComponent’s features. Perhaps we could use the app we have in <code>test</code>? Or maybe we could use ViewComponent previews?</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Add paved path for unit testing components with behaviors</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/904</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How have y’all at Github approached testing view components that have an interactive component to them? We’ve mainly been unit testing each view component we add and then writing feature specs for browser interactions, but I’m wondering if there is a better way to approach it - RailsConf Q&amp;A</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h3>
<p>In Primer ViewComponents, we use system tests powered by cuprite and ViewComponent Previews for testing behaviors. As this approach matures, we should aim to move of much of it as possible into ViewComponent.</p></pre> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h2 id="feature-request">Feature request</h2>
<p>As a consumer of the ViewComponent framework, I want to receive actionable feedback when an error is raised. For every error message, I should be provided with directions on how it might be resolved, and if relevant, a link to more documentation.</p>
<p>As part of this ticket, we should add all error messages to the API documentation.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>In my research on writing technical documentation, several resources recommended providing documentation for all framework-defined error messages, including the actual text of the message, so that if people Google for the message, they are lead to the documentation site.</p></pre> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h2 id="feature-request">Feature request</h2>
<p>It would be lovely if we could support rendering ViewComponents in Jekyll, as it would enable the reuse of ViewComponents across static and dynamic (Rails-based) sites.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>We’ve built out an extensive library of ViewComponents for the Primer design system, but they are currently only able to be used in Rails applications. It would be great to be able to use them in Jekyll sites as well.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Components should play nicely with Rails caching mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/view_component/issues/234</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="feature-request">Feature request</h3>
<p>Components should provide a digest to Rails views, or be able to use Rails explicit caching directive comments or be able to provide a cache_key.</p>
<p>Essentially we should be able to invalidate a cache based on whether the Component class or template has changed.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I’m just building on some previous reports primarily around where templates live and the filenames of the template/s. My concerns come down to integrating with Rails caching basics.</p>
<p>The issue that we run into is basically summed up by</p>
<pre><code>## In any view/partial
cache[object, another_object] do
  render(MyComponent.new(attribute: value))
end</code></pre>
<p>In this case if the template for <code>MyComponent</code> is changed the cache will not be invalidated. I tried to add <code>MyComponent</code> to the array used by <code>cache</code> and provide a <code>self.cache_key</code> method that used <code>ActionView::Digestor</code> but without having some further mechanism to invalidate the digestor’s cache for the template/s when the template changes this didn’t work.</p>
<p>Rails allows for explicit directives to be used (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#explicit-dependencies) but by default this will only look inside <code>app/views</code>. You can add a view path <code>append_view_path(\"app/components\")</code> but the digestor is expecting a partial and so a template filename would have to be prefixed with underscore.</p>
<p>The way we are currently working around this is to have an <code>ApplicationComponent</code> that our components inherit from and where we override <code>ActionView::Component::Base.matching_views_in_source_location</code> so that templates are now found in <code>app/views/component_templates</code> and where the files are prefixed with underscore.</p>
<pre><code>  def self.matching_views_in_source_location
    return [] unless source_location

    *path, file_name = source_location.chomp(File.extname(source_location)).split(\&quot;/\&quot;)
    path.pop # remove components
    path.concat([\&quot;views\&quot;, \&quot;component_templates\&quot;])
    path_to_template = path.push(\&quot;_#{ file_name }\&quot;).join(\&quot;/\&quot;)

    Dir[\&quot;#{ path_to_template }.*{#{ActionView::Template.template_handler_extensions.join(&#39;,&#39;)}}\&quot;]
  end</code></pre>
<p>Then in the above example where cache invalidation does not work via template digest changes we can do</p>
<pre><code>## In any view/partial
# Template Dependency: component_templates/my_component %&gt;
cache[object, another_object] do
  render(MyComponent, attribute: value)
end</code></pre>
<p>I think if AV::C is going to be core or integrate with Rails it would need a way to expose template digests nicely, or provide <code>cache_key</code> probably at the class level. If not then as a last resort we would need a way to use explicit directives in templates that use ActionView::Components internally.</p>
<p>I’d also be all 👂 to people who have solved this already or if I’ve missed something about the features <code>ActionView::Component</code> provides!</p></pre> ]]></description>

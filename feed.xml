<item>	<title>[coredns] default to host configuration not google public</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/1606</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Deploying microk8s on an environment that does not allow access to public domain servers I discovered that the DNS add on is deploying coredns configured with google dns servers hard coded as the default forwarders. It would seem a better option would be to use the hosts DNS configuration rather than a public server that may or may not be allowed on the system.

Referencing https://kube
etes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#coredns this default is what I as a user had expected from coredns. While I can edit the configmap to make changes myself, for a better first time user experience consider using a configuration like this by default.

<item>	<title>Microk8s HA Cluster seems unstable</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/1602</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I'm trying to run a 4 x Pi4 cluster.

Was previously running on 1.18, but I was using latest/stable and things started going wonky this week - issues with pods talking to those on different nodes. When I started looking into things, I noticed it had upgraded to 1.19 at some point. The two <em>may</em> be related, but may not.

In the process of trying to work out what was going on, things got a whole lot worse:
<code>microk8s status</code> said that microk8s wasn't running.
<code>microk8s inspect</code> said everything was fine.
<code>microk8s kubectl</code> said it couldn't connect.

I didn't have a whole lot on my cluster at this point, and everything important is on PVs, so decided to rebuild my cluster, redeploy etc, so I snap removed microk8s from each node, re-installed, checked HA was enabled (because it seems to be a good idea!), re-added the nodes and things were still screwy, but in a different way.

I use lens to manage my cluster and I noticed that lens kept getting disconnected about every 5-10 minutes. I tried deploying something and the deployment was created but no pods were every spun up... I tried looking at logs etc but couldn't find anything obvious so decided to start properly from scratch and reinstalled ubuntu 20.04 on the 4 sd cards.

I've now reinstalled microk8s on each node, checked HA is enabled, added a few other features and added all the nodes... and it still doesn't seem happy.

I'm regularly getting this (though not as often as before I reinstalled from scratch!):

plus one of my nodes, which initially showed as ready, has tu
ed &quot;unhappy&quot; (the wa
ings are because the node has change to &quot;unready&quot;):

I decided to get take a screenshot of just using kubectl and whilst writing this, the same has happened to node 3:

<item>	<title>Question regarding storage on multi-node install</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/1597</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I set up a multi-node install of microk8s 1.19, and enabled storage.

However, when I try to deploy a statefulset with a volume template, I run into issues.

The server pod can be brought up on a different node from the one the PV is actually created on, causing the pod to fail to start, as the directory for the volume does not exist. Is this expected? How can I ensure the volume is provisioned on the correct node?

Here's the relevant bit from my helm template with the volume claim:
<code>yaml

<item>	<title>Microk8s - Error: failed to generate container XX spec: invalid environment variable "xec'</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/1592</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I am using microk8s (+ helmcharts and values) and one of my containers is failing to start with spec: invalid environment variable &quot;xec&quot;. That is the only output I am getting. Interestingly, there are no env vars named &quot;xec&quot; that the container is expecting to have. The service that is failing with the err message &quot;spec: invalid environment variable &quot;xec&quot; has a configmap.yaml, a deployment.yaml and a service.yaml files. The image itself is being pulled from a container registry so I have no control over it. I also tried a newer version of the image, but alas. It works for everyone else. Could it be that microk8s cached some values or there is some bad layer ?
Any ideas ?
Thanks.&quot;</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Guidelines for mimetype icons for packages, archives and more...</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru/issues/2271</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Hi</strong>
Related to the discussion in #2251 

The outcome might just be to leave everything as it is, but if you have any thought please leave them below <span class="citation">@ubuntujaggers</span> <span class="citation">@Feichtmeier</span> <span class="citation">@clobrano</span> <span class="citation">@Jupiter007-43</span> <span class="citation">@avil25

My</span> questions on the current icons:
- The Flatpak pictogram is monochrome. Should they all be this way? Or should we add color to the Flatpak icon?
- Is that a Windows logo? Why not change it like Eaglersdeveloper <a href="https://github.com/snwh/suru-icon-theme/issues/65#issuecomment-399678431">suggested</a>?
- Because the Window files are binary, should they have a solid background too or...?
- Should all of these icons really be packages?
- Or just leave everything as it is 👌 

I have to admit that I'm in a bit over my head here with all the file types, so please be patient 😅 


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3986894/88183034-3ac9f800-cc31-11ea-9c27-a088a7166b05.png" alt="image" />


This looks pretty good, but didn't we already add text for zip, rar, 7z? 🤔 
(doh, a package icon got included here) 😄

Images files. Should these have a background color?

There's a few more files we don't have yet which is for VirtualBox. Here are the icons from Suru++

	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru/issues/2268</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>This issue is for discussing enhancing curl at the bottom of the mimetype icons or adding a paper fold at the top!</strong>


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3986894/88099319-4e2a8400-cb9b-11ea-845a-317a02830904.png" alt="image" />
_Enhanced, Fold and current_ 👆 

For a long time now, I've found the paper curl at the bottom of the mimetype icons to be too subtle. At the moment, the current curl is only present at 256 px (and above ofc). 
The fold would be a clear distinction between the application and file icons.

Adding the top fold, is a very controversial suggestion and it's also a massive amount of work to adapt the current 54 icons. A less intrusive suggestion is to increase the current curl.

In no particular order, here's document icons from OSX, Windows, Humanity, Adwaita, Papirus and Yaru 📄

	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi there, first of all, thanks for this very nice theme.

I'm using Yaru 20.04 on openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap 15.2 with Mate 1.24.0. There is a problem where the OSD horizontal fine-grained level/scale is invisible. Maybe some code could be borrowed from Numix, as it looks perfect under Numix.

Yaru (light and normal all behave the same):

## Expected Behavior
Any day of a different month should be colored differently from the days of the current month. 

## Actual Behavior
Days of a different month that have events are colored the same as days of the current (selected) month (January 1. and 8. in the image above have the wrong color).

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

 1. Add events to the calendar in the beginning or end of a month
 2. Open the calendar and look at the colors of the dates

<item>	<title>Migrate existing user dir to zsys</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/167</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Describe the bug</strong>
How can i migrate existing user dir to zsys?

I have a dpool/home/hcw home folder migrated into a fresh ubuntu 20.04 install
by putting that data under rpool/USERDATA/home/hcw.
However, userdata does not seem to work for that new dataset.

zsysctrl show does only show the ubuntu-created users (there i had created a user hcw, but renamed / moved the dataset).



<strong>To Reproduce</strong>
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install ubuntu 20.04 via &quot;zfs root install&quot; expert / experimental option
2. Create a user &quot;hcw&quot; during install.
3. After install move the rpool/USERDATA/hcw_9y5x50 away by changing the mountpoint.
3. After install copy the other pools dpool/home/hcw to rpool/USERDATA/home/hcw (also create rpool/USERDATA/home).

<strong>Expected behavior</strong>
A documentation should exist how zsys detects user data and how to set up to migrate existing user datasets.

<item>	<title>Feature Request: persistent configurable loglevel</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/153</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Describe the bug</strong>
loglevel changes via <code>zsysctl service loglevel</code> only affect the currently running daemon. This is helpful for debugging problems with manually triggered calls. Unfortunately, since zsysd is socket activated, it goes away fairly quickly, which resets the loglevel back to the 0 (wa
ing). 

Ideally I would like the loglevel to be configurable persistently, perhaps via /etc/zsys.conf
This would greatly facilitate the debugging of timer triggered calls. It would also enable an administrator to search logs for details on actions taken by zsys easily, without having to inspect the <code>zpool history</code> or inspecting the current state and comparing creation times.

<strong>To Reproduce</strong>
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run <code>zsysctl service loglevel 1</code>
2. Wait for next timer to trigger: zsys-gc.timer or zsys-user-savestate.timer
3. Check logs: <code>jou
alctl -u zsysd</code>
4. No interesting log entries found for that trigger

<strong>Expected behavior</strong>
I would have liked to see the loglevel persist at least a little longer than a minute or so. 

<strong>For ubuntu users, please run and copy the following:</strong>
1. <code>ubuntu-bug zsys --save=/tmp/report</code>
2. Copy paste below <code>/tmp/report</code> content:

<item>	<title>Mount an entire state somewhere</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/151</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>It can be very useful to browse the data in zfs snapshots. Snapshots can be browsed from the .zfs directory in the root of any dataset (where zfs will automount them for you on access), and you can mount them manually as well.

The typical Ubuntu zfs installation has a lot of datasets though, which quite fragments things. These exist for good reasons, but it becomes difficult to (for example) browse a coherent view of a specific state, as the state is spread over many datasets.

It would be useful if zsys can be asked to mount an entire state under some directory. This would mount the correct snapshot of each dataset involved in the state at the correct location, reproducing the entire file system (or at least that which is under zsys control) in the target directory. Zfs itself can't do this as it does not have a coherent view of what snapshots belong together, but zsys knows exactly which snapshots make up a state.

One interesting use case for this feature is to make a system state save, mount it somewhere, and then have any regular backup utility (which knows nothing about zfs) back it up. This ensures that the backup is atomic, and asking zsysctl to make and then mount a state save can easily be done from a pre-backup hook or with a script (and the post-backup hook would unmount and then delete the save, of course).&quot;</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Demote and promote snapshots</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/150</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Add a &quot;demote&quot; command to convert a manual state save into an automatic state save.

The use case is that manual saves are taken into account when satisfying the garbage collection policies, and so deleting a manual save may cause unwanted gaps in the time line. But the user should not have to think about that sort of thing when cleaning up. So, it is better to just ask zsys to convert it to an automatic save. From that point zsys can delete it if it's superfluous, or keep it around if needed to satisfy the GC policy.

For example, suppose this time line, where the GC policy says to keep three saves, and currently there are two automatic saves (a) and one manual save (m):
-----------a---------------a-----------------------------m------------------------&gt; (time)
I may decide I don't need that manual save anymore for whatever purpose I made it originally. However, deleting it would lead to this time line:
-----------a---------------a------------------------------------------------------&gt; (time)
This no longer satisfies the policy and leaves a pretty big gap. So, it is not what I actually want.

If the manual save is simply demoted instead, it would lead to this time line:
-----------a---------------a-----------------------------a------------------------&gt; (time)
And all is still well. For now it is kept, and zsys will eventually delete it when it becomes too old.



There should also be a &quot;promote&quot; command, to tu
 an automatic save into a manual save, preventing it from being garbage collected.

The use case for this is when the user notices something has gone wrong but needs time to investigate and decide what to do.

For example, suppose I notice late in the day that some files I was working on got corrupted. And the snapshot made automatically two hours ago is fine, although of course older.

At this point I would not want to revert the entire system, as it's running fine and lots of other things happened (I do not want to revert the state of my browser or rss client for example, if that isn't necessary). I also don't want to just replace the project folder with the snapshot, as then two hours of work are definitely lost.

Instead, I want to compare the snapshot with the current situation (for example with a diff tool) and see what can be salvaged. But it's late in the day and so I leave that for later.

But the next day rolls around and zsys garbage collects, and instead of hourly snapshots I now have three snapshots for yesterday. There is a good chance I now have to work with an older snapshot. This might get even worse if I have to leave it longer (friday to monday for example) as now there's just one snapshot for that day left.

So, I want to be able to &quot;promote&quot; the latest known good snapshot the moment I realize I am going to need it. This makes sure it won't be garbage collected, and names it so I can easily find it later.&quot;</p> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Implement zsysctl state reclaim command</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/121</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <p>Unfortunately, as the history is non linear, there is no easy way to include real snapshot disk usage by snapshots (even upstream ZFS doesn’t have any facilities to that because it’s complex): the real take is &quot;you should combine snapshots to free space, not only one&quot;. If you look at the USE size of a snapshots, you will indeed see very little space that can be taken by only removing on snapshot, as most of the space is common between multiple of them.
So, it’s not an individual snapshots that need to take into account, but a range (including its dependencies).

This command should analyze the best strategy to reclaim spaces by deleting states:
- it should analyzes multiple sets and combination of snapshots and their dependencies
- it should start from the bigger space winner (writing area difference from current filesystem dataset) by looking at what was allocated when and what is out of date to current
- it should give easy <code>zsysctl state remove</code> command line for people to reclaim the state. This should be done by bo
ing with times (and include any dependencies, even if outside of this time range).&quot;</p> ]]></description>

</code>

<strong>Expected behavior</strong>
<code>zsysctl save -s</code> should create snapshots for datasets from both <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code> and <code>dpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code>. I tried associating <code>dpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code> with <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_6pt3c8</code> using <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> property, but it did not result in snapshots being taken as expected.

<code>adduser</code> should create user home under <code>dpool/USERDATA</code>. Snapshots for <code>dpool/USERDATA/rejsmont_ch3gdz</code> are taken as expected though (thanks to <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> property).

	<description><![CDATA[ <p>I created a new dataset for a user, so that I can use zfs native encryption for the home. When I did zsysctl save it told me that there is no association for that user and did some autosave of the old filesystem. Now I destroyed the old file system and now zsysctl errors out because the file system does not exist.
But there is the encrypted file system and its mount point is the home of the user.
How do I associate a zfs with a user, so that zsysctl knows what to do?

Even more fun - and I did not try it yet: ubuntu does not create new zfs for new users but just creates new home-directories under /home which is in rpool/USERDATA thus they will not be able to save their homes. But that is a problem of ubuntu.&quot;</p> ]]></description>

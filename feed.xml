<item>	<title>Microk8s HA Cluster seems unstable</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/1602</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ I'm trying to run a 4 x Pi4 cluster.rnrnWas previously running on 1.18, but I was using latest/stable and things started going wonky this week - issues with pods talking to those on different nodes. When I started looking into things, I noticed it had upgraded to 1.19 at some point. The two _may_ be related, but may not.rnrnIn the process of trying to work out what was going on, things got a whole lot worse:rn`microk8s status` said that microk8s wasn't running.rn`microk8s inspect` said everything was fine.rn`microk8s kubectl` said it couldn't connect.rnrnI didn't have a whole lot on my cluster at this point, and everything important is on PVs, so decided to rebuild my cluster, redeploy etc, so I snap removed microk8s from each node, re-installed, checked HA was enabled (because it seems to be a good idea!), re-added the nodes and things were still screwy, but in a different way.rnrnI use lens to manage my cluster and I noticed that lens kept getting disconnected about every 5-10 minutes. I tried deploying something and the deployment was created but no pods were every spun up... I tried looking at logs etc but couldn't find anything obvious so decided to start properly from scratch and reinstalled ubuntu 20.04 on the 4 sd cards.rnrnI've now reinstalled microk8s on each node, checked HA is enabled, added a few other features and added all the nodes... and it still doesn't seem happy.rnrnI'm regularly getting this (though not as often as before I reinstalled from scratch!):rn![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1851814/94368647-2ac10f80-00dd-11eb-8b5c-53d1d2badb52.png)rnrnplus one of my nodes, which initially showed as ready, has turned "unhappy" (the warnings are because the node has change to "unready"):rn![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1851814/94369027-45948380-00df-11eb-8604-9eb076b36a6c.png)rnrnI decided to get take a screenshot of just using kubectl and whilst writing this, the same has happened to node 3:rn![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1851814/94369075-7eccf380-00df-11eb-9cfc-239c377cf1d4.png)rnrninspection report from node 1:rn[inspection-report-20200927_143617.tar.gz](https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/files/5288567/inspection-report-20200927_143617.tar.gz)rnrninspect report from node 2:rn[inspection-report-20200927_143534.tar.gz](https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/files/5288568/inspection-report-20200927_143534.tar.gz)rn" ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Microk8s - Error: failed to generate container XX spec: invalid environment variable "xec'</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s/issues/1592</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ I am using microk8s (+ helmcharts and values) and one of my containers is failing to start with spec: invalid environment variable "xec". That is the only output I am getting. Interestingly, there are no env vars named "xec" that the container is expecting to have. The service that is failing with the err message "spec: invalid environment variable "xec" has a configmap.yaml, a deployment.yaml and a service.yaml files. The image itself is being pulled from a container registry so I have no control over it. I also tried a newer version of the image, but alas. It works for everyone else. Could it be that microk8s cached some values or there is some bad layer ?rnAny ideas ?rnThanks." ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Feature Request: persistent configurable loglevel</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/153</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ **Describe the bug**rnloglevel changes via `zsysctl service loglevel` only affect the currently running daemon.  This is helpful for debugging problems with manually triggered calls.  Unfortunately, since zsysd is socket activated, it goes away fairly quickly, which resets the loglevel back to the 0 (warning).   rnrnIdeally I would like the loglevel to be configurable persistently, perhaps via /etc/zsys.confrnThis would greatly facilitate the debugging of timer triggered calls.  It would also enable an administrator to search logs for details on actions taken by zsys easily, without having to inspect the `zpool history` or inspecting the current state and comparing creation times.rnrn**To Reproduce**rnSteps to reproduce the behavior:rn1. Run `zsysctl service loglevel 1`rn2. Wait for next timer to trigger:  zsys-gc.timer or zsys-user-savestate.timerrn3. Check logs: `journalctl -u zsysd`rn4. No interesting log entries found for that triggerrnrn**Expected behavior**rnI would have liked to see the loglevel persist at least a little longer than a minute or so.  rnrn**For ubuntu users, please run and  copy the following:**rn1. `ubuntu-bug zsys --save=/tmp/report`rn2.

<item>	<title>Mount an entire state somewhere</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/151</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ It can be very useful to browse the data in zfs snapshots. Snapshots can be browsed from the .zfs directory in the root of any dataset (where zfs will automount them for you on access), and you can mount them manually as well.rnrnThe typical Ubuntu zfs installation has a lot of datasets though, which quite fragments things. These exist for good reasons, but it becomes difficult to (for example) browse a coherent view of a specific state, as the state is spread over many datasets.rnrnIt would be useful if zsys can be asked to mount an entire state under some directory. This would mount the correct snapshot of each dataset involved in the state at the correct location, reproducing the entire file system (or at least that which is under zsys control) in the target directory. Zfs itself can't do this as it does not have a coherent view of what snapshots belong together, but zsys knows exactly which snapshots make up a state.rnrnOne interesting use case for this feature is to make a system state save, mount it somewhere, and then have any regular backup utility (which knows nothing about zfs) back it up. This ensures that the backup is atomic, and asking zsysctl to make and then mount a state save can easily be done from a pre-backup hook or with a script (and the post-backup hook would unmount and then delete the save, of course)." ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Demote and promote snapshots</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/150</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ Add a "demote" command to convert a manual state save into an automatic state save.rnrnThe use case is that manual saves are taken into account when satisfying the garbage collection policies, and so deleting a manual save may cause unwanted gaps in the time line. But the user should not have to think about that sort of thing when cleaning up. So, it is better to just ask zsys to convert it to an automatic save. From that point zsys can delete it if it's superfluous, or keep it around if needed to satisfy the GC policy.rnrnFor example, suppose this time line, where the GC policy says to keep three saves, and currently there are two automatic saves (a) and one manual save (m):rn-----------a---------------a-----------------------------m------------------------> (time)rnI may decide I don't need that manual save anymore for whatever purpose I made it originally. However, deleting it would lead to this time line:rn-----------a---------------a------------------------------------------------------> (time)rnThis no longer satisfies the policy and leaves a pretty big gap. So, it is not what I actually want.rnrnIf the manual save is simply demoted instead, it would lead to this time line:rn-----------a---------------a-----------------------------a------------------------> (time)rnAnd all is still well. For now it is kept, and zsys will eventually delete it when it becomes too old.rnrnrnrnThere should also be a "promote" command, to turn an automatic save into a manual save, preventing it from being garbage collected.rnrnThe use case for this is when the user notices something has gone wrong but needs time to investigate and decide what to do.rnrnFor example, suppose I notice late in the day that some files I was working on got corrupted. And the snapshot made automatically two hours ago is fine, although of course older.rnrnAt this point I would not want to revert the entire system, as it's running fine and lots of other things happened (I do not want to revert the state of my browser or rss client for example, if that isn't necessary). I also don't want to just replace the project folder with the snapshot, as then two hours of work are definitely lost.rnrnInstead, I want to compare the snapshot with the current situation (for example with a diff tool) and see what can be salvaged. But it's late in the day and so I leave that for later.rnrnBut the next day rolls around and zsys garbage collects, and instead of hourly snapshots I now have three snapshots for yesterday. There is a good chance I now have to work with an older snapshot. This might get even worse if I have to leave it longer (friday to monday for example) as now there's just one snapshot for that day left.rnrnSo, I want to be able to "promote" the latest known good snapshot the moment I realize I am going to need it. This makes sure it won't be garbage collected, and names it so I can easily find it later." ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Implement zsysctl state reclaim command</title>
	<link>https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys/issues/121</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ Unfortunately, as the history is non linear, there is no easy way to include real snapshot disk usage by snapshots (even upstream ZFS doesn’t have any facilities to that because it’s complex): the real take is "you should combine snapshots to free space, not only one". If you look at the USE size of a snapshots, you will indeed see very little space that can be taken by only removing on snapshot, as most of the space is common between multiple of them.rnSo, it’s not an individual snapshots that need to take into account, but a range (including its dependencies).rnrnThis command should analyze the best strategy to reclaim spaces by deleting states:rn- it should analyzes multiple sets and combination of snapshots and their dependenciesrn- it should start from the bigger space winner (writing area difference from current filesystem dataset) by looking at what was allocated when and what is out of date to currentrn- it should give easy `zsysctl state remove` command line for people to reclaim the state. This should be done by borning with times (and include any dependencies, even if outside of this time range)." ]]></description>

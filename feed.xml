		<title>Support cloning a gist (just like cloning a repo)</title>
		<link>https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/2115</link>
		<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>In https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/1699#issue-486709880, <span class="citation" data-cites="vilmibm">@vilmibm</span> notes a limitation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no affordance for cloning a gist to do more advance editing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d like to be able to clone a gist, just like I can clone a repo. This is all that’s still needed in order to be able to use <code>gh</code> to enumerate and backup/export (clone) all owned gists.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Sign `gh.exe` binaries in addition to signing the MSI installer</title>
	<link>https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/2111</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>This would help identify Windows binaries that were officially packaged by us vs. ones that might have been modified/corrupted. Right now, we only do signing with the MSI installer.</p>

<item>	<title>Ask to git init on repo create </title>
	<link>https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/2099</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="describe-the-feature-or-problem-youd-like-to-solve">Describe the feature or problem you’d like to solve</h3>
<p>If you run <code>gh repo create</code> in a folder that isn’t initialized with git the command fails.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed solution</h3>
<p>Instead of failing the user would be asked if they want to initialize the current folder a git repo.</p>
<h3 id="additional-context">Additional context</h3>
<p>I would love to take up the implementation of this! The <a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git">go-git</a> module seems like the easiest way to implement this but it is a big dep. Should we just run an exec command or is there some other way to do it?</p>
<p>p.s. thank you for making this awesome cli :)</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Improved user experience: choosealicense.com/appendix</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/703</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>First, I really love this page: <a href="https://choosealicense.com/appendix">https://choosealicense.com/appendix</a></p>
<p>One way it can be improved is to include some "yes/no/undefined" check-boxes along the top of the table.
When you eg: check the box above: "Same License" it brings all "same licenses" to the top &amp; grays out all other licenses.
* If you check several boxes, only those licenses with ALL checked conditions are highlighted.
* Below those (partially grayed out, or something) are licenses that partially match the check-boxes (in decreasing number of matches).
* And below that too is the remaining licenses, totally grayed out.</p>
<p>That would make this page awesome to use.
Thanks &amp; hope this helps.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<p>The article talks about how the Host must match the defined Callback URI, however in the real world, <code>redirect_uri</code> appears to allow subdomains of the Host.</p>
<p>In the article is a truth table. I propose the table is extended to show support for providing a subdomain in the <code>redirect_uri</code>.
Hopefully this also gives a solid example of what I’m asking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The default environment variables that GitHub sets are available to every step in a workflow.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that actions use environment variables to access the filesystem rather than using hardcoded file paths. GitHub sets environment variables for actions to use in all runner environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that one can’t set <code>GITHUB_*</code> / <code>RUNNER_*</code> variables using <code>GITHUB_ENV</code>. However, <code>CI</code> can be set using it.</p>
<p>There should be some documentation about this detail.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="aeisenberg">@aeisenberg</span> mentioned the <code>GITHUB_</code> part in:
https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues/796#issuecomment-1018727859</p>

<item>	<title>Clarify what path value to use when using an action in the same repository as the workflow</title>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>This pertains to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-an-action-in-the-same-repository-as-the-workflow">Using an action in the same repository as the workflow</a> example in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses">section on jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].uses</a>.</p>
<p>The text shows that the value of <code>uses</code> when one want to use an action that is in the same repository as the workflow should be (something of the form) <code>./path/to/dir</code> and then goes on to explain that this means "the path to the directory that contains the action in your workflow’s repository." To any user of any shell, <code>./path/to/dir</code> looks like a relative file path, but the question is then "relative to what?" Relative to the file for the workflow we are currently running? Relative to the root of the repository containing that workflow? (Based on the example that follows, which uses a <code>uses</code> value of <code>./.github/actions/my-action</code>, this would seem a more likely guess.) Relative to the value of <code>$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code>?</p>
<p>In the example given, these last two are the same—that is, <code>$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code> <em>is</em> the root of the repository containing the workflow. But suppose we checked out the repository somewhere else, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          path: source_files
      - name: Use local my-action
        uses: ./.github/actions/my-action</code></pre>
<p>It turns out the <code>my-action</code> action will no longer be found unless we change the value of <code>uses</code> to be relative to the value of <em><code>$GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code></em>; that is, we must modify the last line to be</p>
<pre><code>        uses: ./source_files/.github/actions/my-action</code></pre>
<p>This requirement should be made clear.</p>
<p>Another thing that isn’t made clear is that we apparently <em>must</em> use the leading <code>./</code> when specifying the path. If one is thinking of this the way one usually thinks of file system paths, one might wonder why the value of <code>uses</code> can’t simply be <code>'.github/actions/my-action'</code> (or, for my modified version, <code>source_files/.github/actions/my-action</code>). Presumably, the reason for the "leading <code>./</code>" requirement is that it affords a clear distinction from the case where we are using an action from some (other) public repository: if we write <code>uses: ./actions/heroku</code>, the workflow will look for a file called <code>action/heroku/actions.yml</code> in <em>our</em> repository, whereas if we write <code>uses: actions/heroku</code>, it will look for a file called <code>actions.yml</code> in the root of the <code>actions/heroku</code> repository.</p>
<p>Could we use an absolute path with <code>uses</code>—for example, something like <code>/home/runner/work/.../.github/actions/my-action</code>? This could equally well be thought of as "the path to the directory that contains the action in your workflow’s repository." I haven’t tried this yet, but I suspect the answer is <em>No</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>The current "recommended" mitigation to script injections in GitHub workflows is to use a GitHub Action, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-an-action-instead-of-an-inline-script-recommended</p>
<p>I think this is mis-leading. All this recommendation is doing is tell users to use an action, basically moving the vulnerability inside the action instead of the workflow itself.</p>
<p>As a user, I may create a local Action and introduce the exact same vulnerability using a script, which is not going to mitigate the problem. If the intention is to say "don’t use a script and use javascript, possibly inside an Action", I think that would be fine. But the way it’s phrased right now is mis-leading. Using an Action does <em>not</em> mitigate script injections.</p>
<p>A drawback of GHA is that it’s yet another dependency to maintain and another attack surface.</p>
<p>The right way to fix this vulnerability is to declare an env variable, which is given as a second option. Users worried about script injection in their script are <em>unlikely</em> to move to an Action, which takes additional work. Users use inline scripts because it’s the easy option, so I think we should meet them where they’re at.</p>

<p>Provide an example of using an output for two matrixes.</p>
<p>Often people will want to define a nontrivial matrix and then realize that they want to use it for more than one job and know that they don’t want to copy and paste the definition because that’s brittle. But they won’t know how to share the definition for use by more than one matrix job.</p>

<p>This question comes up often enough, e.g. here:</p>
<p>https://github.community/t/can-i-share-strategy-matrices-between-multiple-jobs/195827/7</p>
<p>Sadly, as you can see, people often get/give the wrong answer (no, you can’t). Since it’s definitely possible, and actually fairly easy, but not terribly obvious, it’d be helpful if it were documented.</p>

<h3 id="what-changes-are-you-suggesting">What changes are you suggesting?</h3>
<p>The existing documentation for file syntax does not make it explicitly clear that a pattern can only be specified once, and that if &gt;1 instance of a pattern is present, the last instance will take precedence.</p>
<p>For example the following example would only request review from <code>@doctocat</code>, <code>@octocat</code> would not be included in the reviewers.</p>
<pre><code>apps/ @octocat
apps/ @doctocat</code></pre>
<p>I would propose that a line be added to the <code>CODEOWNERS syntax</code> section indicating that a repeated pattern is not supported.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>Additionally, I believe an issue should be raised internally against the validation of codeowners files - the above example will be marked as valid by the CODEOWNERS validation, and will not provide any indication to the end user that only the last instance of the pattern will be used.</p>

<p>I would like more expansion on the actual structure of the <code>package_version</code> object described – it doesn’t seem to match any documented objects from the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/packages">Packages</a> page, and the actual payload seems to vary from what is documented. https://github.com/google/go-github/issues/2033 is related – we’re seeing an object come through as the body, when a string is expected (and documented!).</p>
<p>My best guess is that this data varies based on whether there’s a repository associated with the package.</p>

This is important because improper use (as noted in the issue) could result in exfiltration of plaintext secret values in workflow logs before being masked.

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>I’d like to see clarification around what it means for Octokit to be an official library and/or removal of octokit/octokit.js as an official library.</p>
<p>When Dependabot calls out a vulnerability in octokit.js, it being documented as "the official Octokit library" suggests GitHub will do things to address the vulnerability. I’d like to see this document clarify whether that’s the case.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>I read "the official Octokit library" in GitHub’s documentation to mean GitHub endorses and supports users’ use of Octokit, and may sponsor maintenance of the library’s projects. I struggle to imagine the official library being un-maintained.</p>
<p>Last year <span class="citation" data-cites="gr2m">@gr2m</span> <a href="https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/discussions/620#discussioncomment-1472174">explained</a>:</p>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>YAML treats floats like <code>2.10</code> as <code>2.1</code>. This can lead to workflows using a different language version than intended. We should update the YAML examples to quote language versions to avoid this. To help users who copy-paste-modify without understanding the nuance, we should quote all language versions, even ones that would not be affected by this parsing.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]</code></pre>
<p>should be changed to</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [\&quot;3.6\&quot;, \&quot;3.7\&quot;, \&quot;3.8\&quot;, \&quot;3.9\&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Then if a user copies the example but wants to include version 3.10, they can easily plug in the new value without knowing they need to add quotes.</p>

<p>I’ve already transferred a repository. The documentation states "All links to the previous repository location are automatically redirected to the new location.", which is working great. However, now I would like to know if I can create a fork back to the original account, without destroying those redirects.</p>
<p>Intuitively I would think, that the redirects will be lost entirely, when I would simply fork the repository, but it would be helpful if the docs could confirm this.</p>
<p>As a workaround to this, I am thinking about forking to a temporary account first, then renaming the repository (since it doesn’t seem possible to rename while forking), and then transferring the renamed repository to the original account. Before I do this I would like to be sure that the redirects will keep working for the original name, and I think similarly it would be helpful if the docs could include some information about this.</p>

<p>This means that the status quo instructions promoting either <code>eval $(ssh-agent -s)</code> or <code>eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"</code> will not work for some users, but will also not provide useful output. For me, either above command does nothing in PowerShell or cmd.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>A succinct emendation is to recommend <code>Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Get-Process</code> in a PowerShell host to find the <code>ssh-agent</code> process ID.</p>
<p>A more detailed suggestion is to walk the reader through scrupulously determining what is providing <code>ssh-agent</code>, if anything.</p>

<item>	<title>[Improvement]: Add instructions for increasing resources for GitHub Enterprise Server instances on Google Cloud Platform</title>
	<link>https://github.com/github/docs/issues/9240</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p><strong>What feature or product is affected?</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Enterprise Server.</p>
<p><strong>What is the new or expected behavior?</strong></p>
<p>It’d be good to include some advice for increasing hardware resources available to GitHub Enterprise Server instances on Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p><strong>How is the old or inaccurate behavior currently documented?</strong></p>
<p>"<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/enterprise-management/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources">Increasing CPU or memory resources</a>" only addresses GitHub Enterprise Server instances hosted on AWS, Azure, KVM, and VMware. It’d be nice to include instructions for increasing resources for instances hosted on Google Cloud Platform, or at least write a blurb at the top of the page with any known limitations or high-level instructions. (We link to this article from the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance">various articles on installing GitHub Enterprise Server</a>, so right now, administrators on Google Cloud Platform might end up at this article, but they won’t see any instructions for their hypervisor.)</p>
<p><strong>Who does this affect?</strong></p>
<p>Administrators of GitHub Enterprise Server using Google Cloud Platform.</p>
<p><strong>What is the impact to users?</strong></p>
<p>Folks might contact support for instructions. Since GitHub doesn’t own Google Cloud Platform, sometimes we then have to point the customer to other documentation, so it’s potentially a frustrating adventure to find the information that you need for upgrading the virtual machine you’re running 😅</p>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have a section about transferring action repositories and another about some finer details regarding the marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repo can be transferred and actions will continue to work because there is a redirect in place (users of the action won’t have to update their workflows)</li>
<li>An action in the marketplace is linked to a repository by ID, allowing for new releases to be published under the same marketplace listing from the "new" repo</li>
<li>If an action repository is deleted, so is the marketplace listing. The unique <code>name</code> identifier becomes available again.</li>
<li>The <code>verified</code> status seen on GitHub org profiles is different from the marketplace <code>verified</code> badge. By transferring an action repo, the owner changes and the marketplace badge will be lost unless the new owner is a verified publisher too.</li>
</ul>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-article-on-docs.github.com-is-affected">What article on docs.github.com is affected?</h3>
<p>This could effect a variety of GitHub articles, since we want to add links in articles, where it makes sense, to GitHub Classroom articles.</p>
<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>Here are 4 examples of articles that could benefit from a link to GitHub Classroom articles:
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-template-repository">Creating a template repository</a>” - To this article about template repositories, we can add a link to this GitHub Classroom article “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-assignment-from-a-template-repository">Create an assignment from a template repository</a>” so that those learning how to create a template repository are aware they can be used in GitHub Classroom.
- “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment#creating-a-pull-request-for-feedback">Create an individual assignment</a>” - To this page in GitHub Classroom, the section “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment#creating-a-pull-request-for-feedback">Creating a pull request for feedback</a>” which is specifically about enabling feedback pull requests to be automatically created for each student submission, we can add a link to this article, “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests">Leave feedback with pull requests</a>” , which goes into more detail about how to leave feedback in those pull requests.
- To either “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/about-integrations">About integrations</a>” or “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/github-extensions-and-integrations">GitHub extensions and integrations</a>”, we can link out to “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide">Integrate GitHub Classroom with an IDE</a>”, in the context of giving an example of an integration with GitHub specific to education, allowing students to develop in an online IDE.
- This is a bit more vague, but we could add a link in some page about GitHub Actions, such as “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration">About continuous integration</a>” to “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/use-autograding">Use autograding</a>” as an example of one way continuous integration and GitHub Actions is used, in an education/classroom context.</p>
<p>There may be other articles out there that could also use links to GitHub Classroom articles (including GitHub Classroom articles themselves) - feel free to explore and find other places!</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>When you add the link, you would usually want to add it a new paragraph or a "Further reading" section if it doesn’t fit in any of the existing sections. When we link to other articles, we often start with "For more information, see [link]". In this case, you could also say something like "To see an example of how [feature] is used in GitHub Classroom, see [link]" - whatever wording makes clear why they might find it useful or of interest to go to that link.</p>

<h3 id="what-parts-of-the-article-would-you-like-to-see-updated">What part(s) of the article would you like to see updated?</h3>
<p>the part that you can use a token for maven-repositories is wrong. You can see here, that you still need to defined username and password even when you use a token, as you can see in this PR https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/3403/files#diff-48b048f6d8a8b732434e30d186e65de8e3303c03308c116f8e078697b372abecR312
If you try to use the "token" keyword you will get an error from dependabot, so the documentation is not up-to-date for maven-repositories.</p>

<p>_Update May 6, 2021 ✏️ by <span class="citation" data-cites="felicitymay_">@felicitymay_</span></p>
<p>I looked into this problem with the engineering team. I wanted to make sure that this was a docs issue and not a bug in Dependabot. During our investigation, it became clear that the existing information about <code>username</code>, <code>password</code> and <code>token</code> was too brief and that this issue needed a larger-scale change to the article.</p>
<h4 id="tech-summary">Tech summary</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>token</code> is used to provide an access token for an external system and should not be used to provide a GitHub personal access token. It’s supported only by: <code>npm-registry</code>, <code>nuget-feed</code>, <code>python-index</code>, <code>rubygems-server</code>. As highlighted by this issue, it is not supported for <code>maven-repository</code>.</li>
<li><code>username</code> should be an account username or email address.</li>
<li><code>password</code> should be a password for the account specified by the <code>username</code>. If this is a GitHub account, you can use a GitHub personal access token in place of the password.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="docs-changes-needed">Docs changes needed</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#configuration-options-for-private-registries">Configuration options for private registries</a> section:
<ul>
<li>Expand the information in the table for <code>token</code>, <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> so that their use is clear. In particular, explain that a <code>token</code> is for an external system and that when you want to use a GitHub access token you should supply it as a <code>password</code>.</li>
<li>Update all descriptions: "The <system> type supports username and password." to explain that the password can be a GitHub personal access token.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#registries">registries</a> section:

<li>Update the <code>maven-github</code> example to use a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> with an access token.</li>
<li>Remove <code>token</code> from this example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="https://docs-5868--patch-1.herokuapp.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#git">git</a> example, change the username to: <code>username: octocat</code>.</li>

<p>As a windows user, i found it confusing to apply <code>chmod</code> and stumbled over a permission denied error, when I tried to run anyways. For windows users, the solution is to tell git this way:

<p>In https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/managing-complex-workflows#creating-dependent-jobs, the possibility of constraining jobs to run sequentially without the failure of earlier jobs in the sequence preventing the later jobs from running: <em>If one of the jobs fails, all dependent jobs are skipped; however, if you need the jobs to continue, you can define this using the if conditional statement.</em></p>
<p>I had expected, thus, to see an example of how to do this, either directly here or in one of the two linked-to articles (either https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif or https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds).</p>
<p>It is not clear what sort of "if" statement is called for, nor whether it should supplement or replace the "needs" directive. The https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds article reiterates the possibility of constraining jobs to run in sequence without failing jobs preventing later jobs from running: <em>If a job fails, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional statement that causes the job to continue.</em> This at least suggests that the "if" statement supplements the "needs" directive, but again, there is no example given of how to do this.</p>
<p>Since the <em>Creating dependent jobs</em> article occurs in the <em>Learn GitHub Actions</em> section of the documentation, it would probably be better to just omit the comment about allowing dependent jobs to run when their precursors fail, or at least to provide or link to an example the clarifies how to set this up.</p>
